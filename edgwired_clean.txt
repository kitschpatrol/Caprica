18,107810740.4,Edgwired,she wasn't sure that you two knew that i wanted to be the fourth roommate
18,107810748.3,Edgwired,so she thought we should talk about it
18,107810752.2,Other,ahhhh no actually i dont think we did
18,107810774.2,Other,i mean i told maria on the boat that we had someone who had asked before she had
18,107810781.5,Other,this girl kristen

18,107810847.7,Edgwired,it's cool either way
18,107810868.6,Edgwired,basically it's like this
18,107810885.8,Edgwired,"if you and imri were good with it, maria and i could pretty much commit to moving in"
18,107810887.6,Edgwired,and
18,107810892.9,Edgwired,if Wes needs to stay two more weeks
18,107810895.8,Edgwired,then that's cool too
18,107810901.9,Edgwired,because i'm not on a schedule to move really
18,107810908.8,Edgwired,just would like to get back into the city
18,107810912.4,Edgwired,to make the job easier
18,107810984.3,Edgwired,i already respect the both of you enough to be sure for myself

18,107811022,Other,"he was intent on leaving, as was i, but I had to ixnay the last minute"
18,107811027.8,Edgwired,yeah
18,107811035.3,Edgwired,i think maybe just until the 1st of August for him?
18,107811045,Other,"yeah perhaps wes should talk with us about it, but he's been moody"
18,107811058.2,Other,well he has till the 31st of july to move
18,107811058.9,Edgwired,i've been letting maria take the lead because she's better at discussing than I
18,107811064.9,Other,unless he decides he's staying
18,107811070.4,Edgwired,yeah
18,107811078.5,Edgwired,maria and i were looking for a place together
18,107811088.4,Other,"wich if he does stay, i think it would be odd with maria there..."

18,107811120.3,Edgwired,not because they have problems
18,107811125,Edgwired,but just because
18,107811130,Edgwired,too early maybe
18,107811135.3,Other,hehe no need to explain that
18,107811155.5,Other,"if wes will even talk to me, ill have a chat with him and imri tonight..."
18,107811172,Other,"thing is, if juan is the only one moving, i dont think we will take on another roomate"

19,109531766.4,Edgwired,ok
19,109531771.5,Other,"u need 1st, last, and security to move in"

19,109531953.1,Other,"about two months ago, i entertained my brother as a possibility"
19,109531961.9,Other,"and before we even agreed i was staying, i ruled that out"
19,109531972.1,Other,"then, a girl named kristin wanted to move in"
19,109531986.8,Other,"imri did not want her to, because she is young"
19,109531994.9,Edgwired,ok
19,109532005.5,Other,i had wanted my girlfriend to live there
19,109532011.3,Other,but imri doesnt want that either
19,109532026.3,Edgwired,ok
19,109532029.9,Edgwired,so
19,109532034.9,Edgwired,maria is coming over to swim in a minute
19,109532043.2,Edgwired,can i just tell her that we should get this arranged?
19,109532073.5,Edgwired,we talked to Imri about it last week
19,109532085.6,Edgwired,and he was cool with it as long as we talked to you
19,109532196.6,Edgwired,what i'm really trying to decide is how much money i can put on this party this weekend
19,109532207,Edgwired,and still come out well enough to buy furniture
19,109532627.8,Edgwired,"haha, my friend Dan says that he's listened to Breakdown 3 well over a hundred times and he wants a new one."

19,109532697.2,Edgwired,np
19,109532716.6,Other,yeah so i guess it comes out to either 1155 for my old room
19,109532724.4,Other,or 1375 for wes's
19,109532736.1,Edgwired,ok
19,109532742.7,Other,i have to double check on the rent for wes's room tho
19,109532750.6,Other,but i believe he's been paying 445 a month
19,109532754.9,Other,but rent goes up this year
19,109532760.1,Other,so it will be 455 a month
19,109532766.8,Edgwired,ok
19,109532770.2,Edgwired,i've got that down
19,109532773.8,Edgwired,that's definitely good to know
19,109532781.1,Edgwired,going to take the month to put it together
19,109532788.4,Other,im assuming maria would take wes's old room?
19,109532795.7,Edgwired,most likely
19,109532900.2,Other,u know anyone else looking for a place besides you two?
19,109532905.1,Other,i am just curious
19,109532922.7,Edgwired,"um, i've had a few people express interest"

20,103416439.7,Edgwired,tough to say which school i could get in
20,103416445,Other,so sort of like what your doing now?
20,103416464.6,Edgwired,"yup, except doing it for real instead of bullshitting"

20,103416522.9,Other,thats always a plus.....hows the selling coming?
20,103416536.9,Other,the japan interviews?
20,103416540,Edgwired,they're good on the investment side and horrible with the marketing
20,103416541,Edgwired,yup
20,103416575.4,Other,yeah that can be tough.....but its all just selling themselves right?
20,103416613,Edgwired,that's what they're pretty good at.. i think the retail strategy is dumb though... my opinion is that we should start with big institutional licenses and then sell to individuals
20,103416654.3,Other,yeah thats probably true. just as long as they keep paying YOU thats all that matters........at this point
20,103416659.3,Edgwired,HA
20,103416660.1,Edgwired,right
20,103416671.9,Edgwired,they said they would break their lease at the office before they stopped paying me and Gonzo
20,103416681.1,Edgwired,so even if we do run out of money

20,103418361,Other,thats strange....why?
20,103418368.1,Edgwired,well the one company was like
20,103418418.1,Edgwired,"this isn't an exchange program.. this is like any other job that just happens to be in Japan.. you're not going to get to travel and the people in Japan aren't going to ever totally accept you."
20,103418427.5,Edgwired,and the one patrick works for
20,103418431,Edgwired,was completely the opposite
20,103418453.6,Other,damn that sucks.....not very marketing
20,103418472.5,Edgwired,i guess they get enough people who want to go that they can be like that

98,119073491.4,Other,god ripped me of that gay trait
98,119073499.4,Edgwired,that sounds reasonable.. you first need to decide if you like my style
98,119073508.2,Edgwired,i can design well

98,119073930.9,Edgwired,although i just spent over $160 on paint for my bedroom
98,119073934,Other,what u mean by finish
98,119073966.7,Edgwired,"there are processes you can apply to the walls to make them have metallic crackle, or look like leather, or look like denim, or have a stone finish"

104,119902359.2,Other,i may have to wait til after christmas
104,119902375.1,Other,maybe the living room before hand though
104,119902384.3,Other,just not the whole house right away
104,119902415.4,Edgwired,"I was thinking I could do the whole thing for $2000, but if you want to just do the living room, then it would be much cheaper"
104,119902417,Other,what were ya thinking
104,119902427,Edgwired,$2000 plus materials
104,119902432.4,Edgwired,or $2500 materials included
104,119902463.1,Other,how much w/ materials do you think for my room downstairs
104,119902475.6,Edgwired,100 - 150

104,119902557.8,Edgwired,X 2 gallons for the walls
104,119902565.4,Edgwired,1 for the trim if it's a different color

104,119902585.8,Edgwired,although
104,119902600.2,Edgwired,your downstairs would look hot with a kind of sand finish to it

104,119902944.1,Edgwired,"a sprayer is this machine you use to get the paint really smooth. used instead of a roller, and is much quicker in the long run"
104,119902956.5,Other,lol well you will have to come over and tell me what you think like colors and stuff cause i really have no clue

185,102285834.2,Edgwired,the screenshot
185,102285839.8,Edgwired,because in this particular case
185,102285843.7,Edgwired,the screenshot will look awful
185,102285849.4,Other,excellent
185,102285873.9,Other,just as long as it is clear that they are entries in a date
185,102285878.3,Other,and not just the buttons
185,102285889.6,Other,maybe have sample text next to them

187,102292726.9,Edgwired,what do you mean?
187,102292864.4,Other,now that i look at it
187,102292883.8,Other,the information is awkward
187,102292901.8,Other,we display descriptions or details for the six applications
187,102292912.2,Other,"aside from that, only help and email"
187,102292944.2,Edgwired,it doesn't lay out well

187,102293009.5,Edgwired,no
187,102293013.6,Edgwired,that doesn't solve my problem
187,102293021.1,Edgwired,because i still have to find a way to lay it out
187,102293026.2,Edgwired,with the text the way it is
187,102293038.6,Edgwired,if i could find a way to do it
187,102293039,Other,you can't just use a new screenshot?
187,102293044,Edgwired,then there's no need to get rid of it
187,102293047.7,Other,and leave everything else the same
187,102293052.5,Other,?
187,102293053.3,Edgwired,no
187,102293058.9,Edgwired,everything

187,102293070.6,Edgwired,this
187,102293073.2,Edgwired,and teh dvd cover

187,102293199.5,Other,does that help at all?
187,102293206.7,Edgwired,not really
187,102293212.7,Edgwired,forget it
187,102293215.7,Edgwired,i'll figure something out
187,102293236.1,Other,the problem with taht is that you may cut something that shoujldn't be cut
187,102293245.8,Edgwired,i'm not going to cut anything
187,102293250.9,Other,ok

195,102362701.5,Edgwired,but why not

195,102362736.2,Edgwired,ah
195,102362748.3,Other,i'm in the process of getting that shit fixed
195,102362751.6,Other,its all screwed up
195,102362763.2,Other,no more changes to that website before they are reviewed

195,102362791.2,Edgwired,and changes like these
195,102362796.6,Edgwired,are supposed to be cleared by me
195,102362798.8,Edgwired,before they go live
195,102362802.2,Edgwired,because you're right
195,102362806.1,Edgwired,now that i'm looking at this
195,102362808.3,Edgwired,it looks like shit
195,102362811.3,Edgwired,so
195,102362812.3,Edgwired,WHY
195,102362816.2,Other,esp if you minimize horizontally

195,102363122.6,Other,"ok, what do you suggest"
195,102363124.1,Other,from this point
195,102363193.4,Other,gonzo is working on changes as we speak

196,102371630.6,Other,what gzo used for those buttons is arial
196,102371673.9,Other,ok
196,102371699.8,Other,"the understanding here is that all text that is actually an image,, (menu, buttons, logo, etc) should be the optima or whatever font it is that you used"
196,102371707.1,Other,"and that the text that is just text,,, is arial"

196,102371721.7,Edgwired,should be helvetica
196,102371727.1,Edgwired,the text in the menu is optima
196,102371736.5,Edgwired,the text over the buttons he uses here

196,102371757.3,Other,ok
196,102371767,Edgwired,"as far as i know, he rewrote all of the buttons with text overlays"

196,102371778.9,Edgwired,if not verdana

196,102371794.7,Edgwired,arial
196,102371806.2,Edgwired,that's the way the stylesheet was originally written when i gave it to him
196,102371867.4,Edgwired,if there are going to be four buttons
196,102371894.6,Edgwired,they need to be spaced a little farther from the text and each other
196,102371900.8,Other,good point
196,102371904.1,Edgwired,i don't like them center aligned
196,102371907.6,Edgwired,but without descriptions
196,102371913.7,Edgwired,they won't work that well left aligned
196,102371925.9,Edgwired,i still don't understand the use of buttons instead of the menu
196,102371937.4,Edgwired,really
196,102371943.5,Edgwired,i don't understand the use of buttons
196,102371947.3,Edgwired,when text will work just find
196,102371948.4,Edgwired,fine
196,102371953.3,Edgwired,as it does in the rest of the site
196,102371955.9,Edgwired,REALLY
196,102371962.2,Edgwired,i just want to redo the whole fucking thing

196,102372003.3,Edgwired,fuck it
196,102372007.9,Edgwired,tell gonzo to get rid of the buttons
196,102372013,Edgwired,and make them text links like everything else

197,102380675.1,Edgwired,why are the fuel injectors better?
197,102380694.3,Other,because carbeurators suck ass

197,102380985.9,Other,and less weight to hold up

203,102536767.2,Other,why is cash better?
203,102536777.1,Edgwired,quicker
203,102536800,Other,hot
203,102536800.8,Other,city
204,102537547.1,Other,that means i can take back the memory card too
204,102537553.2,Edgwired,yup
204,102537562.9,Edgwired,the packaging is a little tricky
204,102537592.8,Other,steam

205,102545263.9,Other,nada
205,102545268.6,Other,gettin excited for ps2
205,102545284.2,Edgwired,when are you getting it?
205,102545731.9,Edgwired,have you seen the beginners manual?
205,102545738.3,Other,eh
205,102545740.9,Other,briefly
205,102545742,Other,whats up
205,102545763.5,Edgwired,i seem to recall him saying that we didn't need illustrations to go with the text
205,102545773.1,Edgwired,but i could be making that up
205,102545790.7,Edgwired,for purposes of convenience
205,102545794.3,Edgwired,because
205,102545802.6,Edgwired,the text could definitely use illustrations
205,102545815.3,Edgwired,really
205,102545823.9,Edgwired,i'm wondering what he wants me to do with it
205,102545847.1,Other,i also got the impression that we were not going to do graphics on that manual
205,102545851.6,Edgwired,k
205,102545863.7,Edgwired,fine
205,102545865.8,Edgwired,better for me
205,102545866.9,Edgwired,but
205,102545877,Edgwired,diagrams would probably help in the long run
205,102545905.7,Other,i agree
205,102546186.2,Edgwired,so i laid out the qrg
205,102546188.3,Edgwired,alarm thing
205,102546189.3,Edgwired,and
205,102546192.3,Edgwired,it's only a page
205,102546226.8,Other,sounds good?
205,102546235.3,Edgwired,not good
205,102546242.2,Other,i know
205,102546243.8,Other,i was hoping
205,102546264,Other,can you send me that one page?
205,102546562.7,Other,there isn't a whole lot explaining that the appointment icons appear in each date
205,102546591.9,Edgwired,do you really think there needs to be?
205,102546599.4,Other,to fill space.... yes
205,102546602.2,Edgwired,that seems obvious to me
205,102546607.4,Edgwired,plus
205,102546620.4,Other,right.. but i think it would be clearer to a novice if you showed them an example of where those icons appear
205,102546623.7,Edgwired,they appear where they appear
205,102546632.4,Edgwired,i don't know how you quantify thatt
205,102546636.6,Edgwired,beyond what's there
205,102546640.5,Edgwired,and anyway
205,102546646.3,Other,put a screen shot of the icons IN a date
205,102546653.3,Edgwired,ok
205,102546657.8,Edgwired,well

206,102619481.2,Edgwired,but
206,102619490.1,Edgwired,it would save me the hassle of coming back into the city

206,102619511.2,Other,what time are you there until?
206,102619531.1,Edgwired,until it becomes apparent that no one else is showing up and i run out of things to do

206,102619587.7,Other,"i don't want you guys to have to deal with late checks, ever"
206,102619593.2,Other,i'm sick of that shit
206,102619594.2,Edgwired,well hey
206,102619596.6,Edgwired,that makes two of us
206,102619606.6,Other,iknow

206,102619632,Other,she pointed
206,102619633.9,Other,no ps2
206,102619637.4,Edgwired,fuck
206,102619643.2,Other,"oh, someone must have bought the last one"
206,102619645.6,Edgwired,:(
206,102619655.3,Edgwired,you bitch
206,102619671.2,Edgwired,that's cuz they know they can take that shit back
206,102619680.7,Edgwired,best buy's return policy is deceptive and stupid
206,102619686.1,Other,yeah
206,102619700.4,Other,so i'm left waiting until ghettomart gets another ps2 shipment
206,102619707.5,Edgwired,ha
206,102619713,Edgwired,did they have any idea when that was?
206,102619716.3,Other,no
206,102619720.1,Edgwired,right
206,102619720.2,Other,they get shipments daily
206,102619729,Other,but don't know when a ps2 will be on those shipments
206,102619736.7,Edgwired,fucking brilliant
206,102619748,Other,naturalkly
206,102619757.2,Edgwired,you know
206,102619764.7,Edgwired,we live in the fourth largest city in the United States
206,102619771.5,Other,"wait,, youare in the office?"
206,102619781.2,Edgwired,I find it hard to believe there are no acceptable places to buy what is a pretty common consumable
206,102619787,Edgwired,yes
206,102619788,Other,walk over to gzo and tell him to kill gambitdesign
206,102619789.2,Edgwired,in the office
206,102619795.5,Edgwired,he disappeared
206,102619797.8,Edgwired,but i'll tell him
206,102619800.2,Other,alright
206,102619803.5,Other,i emailed him tooo
206,102619814.8,Other,"yeah, i agree with you about the fourth largest city shit"
206,102619962.1,Edgwired,i forgot my mouse
206,102619970.1,Edgwired,what is there left to do
206,102620039.5,Other,you have everything up to date?
206,102620043.1,Other,all printed materials?
206,102620073.6,Edgwired,i think so
206,102620102.4,Other,box?
206,102620110.7,Edgwired,yeah
206,102620113.4,Edgwired,i forgot my mouse
206,102620115.3,Other,you have a final mock-up of the box ready to be presented ?
206,102620120.8,Edgwired,no
206,102620140.3,Other,so you are saying that you can't work on anything without your mouse?
206,102620148.6,Edgwired,i can
206,102620154.8,Edgwired,just hopefully not the box
206,102620163.1,Edgwired,the box
206,102620164.3,Edgwired,right now
206,102620165.9,Edgwired,is a problem
206,102620177,Other,why
206,102620185.1,Edgwired,depth perception
206,102620193.9,Edgwired,lots of reason
206,102620194.7,Edgwired,s
206,102620202.8,Other,but the old fuckers in the background
206,102620206.7,Other,the kite inthe fore
206,102620211.2,Other,i don't know what to tell you....
206,102620214.9,Edgwired,it's really not that simple
206,102620225.6,Other,the kite was supposed to be the centerpiece
206,102620231.8,Edgwired,yeah
206,102620235.3,Edgwired,that's a problem too
206,102620241.2,Other,"if the concept is impossible, then we need to switch to a new one as soon as possible"
206,102620275.2,Edgwired,"probably not impossible, but it needs to cook in the back of my head for a while"
206,102620371.7,Other,"the only idea i would have would be putting SimpleC in the upper left, the kite in the fore upper right with string to the people or chair in the lower left background, and whatever wording in the lower right"
206,102620385.6,Edgwired,that's the idea
206,102620415.7,Edgwired,but the angle at which your eye sees the kite in relation to the grass in relation to the chair in relation to the people (if there are even people) is precise
206,102620420.3,Edgwired,and difficult to achieve
206,102620432.5,Other,gotcha
206,102620439,Other,the cd label is too red
206,102620443,Other,can we inverse that?
206,102620443.5,Edgwired,yeah
206,102620448.9,Edgwired,i thought it might be
206,102620454,Edgwired,we can
206,102620461.4,Edgwired,but it's going to look exactly like the video cd
206,102620511.1,Other,"did jason not say to have the video cd read ""SimpleC Smiling Screens Case Study""??"
206,102620532.2,Other,"just curious because in the video it says ""Smiling Screens Case Study"
206,102620548.9,Edgwired,it says SimpleC Case study
206,102620558.1,Other,in the video?
206,102620566.6,Edgwired,i haven't seen the video
206,102620573.3,Other,that's what i'm referring to
206,102620579.9,Other,in the video
206,102620582.1,Other,it says
206,102620586.8,Other,Smiling Screens Case Study
206,102620616.4,Edgwired,would he rather use the Smiling Screens logo?
206,102620623.5,Other,no
206,102620635.2,Edgwired,then as far as I'm concerned it's SimpleC
206,102620638.2,Other,i think it is important to tie it to simplec
206,102620660.6,Other,what do you think
206,102620666,Edgwired,that's what i think
206,102620672.4,Edgwired,i think
206,102620679.3,Edgwired,that if we're going to tie in Smiling Screens
206,102620685.9,Edgwired,then we need to talk about how they relate to each other
206,102620687.3,Edgwired,because
206,102620687.6,Other,the idea is that we are/will send this video along with all other SimpleC materials to an assisted living or other senior care facility
206,102620691.4,Edgwired,we've never done that before
206,102620698.3,Edgwired,what i really thing
206,102620699.8,Edgwired,think
206,102620705,Edgwired,is that the video is mistitled
206,102620708.7,Edgwired,because up to now
206,102620714.2,Other,how SimpleC and Smiling Screens relate to each other?
206,102620721.2,Edgwired,"we were minimizing ""Smiling Screens"" right out of the picture"
206,102620735,Other,well
206,102620745.8,Edgwired,put it this way
206,102620756.6,Other,the only way it makes sense to me is that Smiling Screens is the company that produces simplec
206,102620764.3,Edgwired,"the SimpleC logo never gets associated with anything but ""SimpleC"
206,102620765.6,Other,and smiling screens was the company that executed the study
206,102620776.8,Edgwired,"if he wants ""Smiling Screens Case Study"
206,102620781.8,Edgwired,then we use the Smiling Screens logo
206,102620788.3,Other,then we use SSI logo
206,102620805.2,Edgwired,i want to talk to Jason about it
206,102620829.6,Other,in your opinion... do you think the oganizations we would send this to would be able to make the connection?
206,102620845.4,Edgwired,i have no way of gauging that
206,102620877.9,Other,but you can give me your opinion
206,102620912.4,Edgwired,"well, i seem to be constantly overestimating the intelligence of the average person, but really, i don't see why not"
206,102620946.4,Other,"i think as long as we include a letter printed on SSI letterhead mentioning ""our product, simpleC"
206,102620950.8,Other,it should be cleaer
206,102620965.7,Edgwired,k
206,102620983.9,Other,i'd have to watch the video one more time
206,102620994.1,Other,to see how much simplec and ssi are mentioned
206,102621022.7,Edgwired,i'm not going to fool with it right now
206,102621027.3,Edgwired,brb
206,102621035.1,Other,that's agreeable
206,102621227.1,Edgwired,k
206,102621228.8,Edgwired,so what now
206,102621305.1,Other,"so, box is out"
206,102621310.8,Edgwired,pretty much
206,102621311.4,Other,vid cd label is out
206,102621337,Edgwired,yes
206,102621396,Edgwired,i'm going to help gonzo with a video
206,102621411.2,Other,alright
207,102626451.6,Other,smilingscreens email and tutos are worthless
207,102626456.3,Other,so damn slow
207,102626468.3,Edgwired,i haven't been using them
207,102626470.9,Other,yeah

209,102888524.5,Edgwired,i'm sort of working on the box
209,102888604.5,Other,alright
209,102888619.4,Other,everything else is done?
209,102888626.3,Other,you have the materials for SG to send out?
209,102888633.6,Edgwired,as far as i know
209,102888636.5,Edgwired,no brochure
209,102888637.8,Other,ok
209,102888638.6,Edgwired,or qrg
209,102888644.3,Edgwired,but he didn't really ask
209,102888700,Other,the brochure is done right?
209,102888711.1,Other,both are done
209,102888716.3,Other,as far as I thought
209,102888718.3,Edgwired,the brochure is printable
209,102888734.2,Edgwired,i think that i'm going to take the scary white fuckers off the front
209,102888739.9,Edgwired,and make it look like the box
209,102888748,Edgwired,the qrg is also printable
209,102888753.6,Edgwired,but if we were going to mass produce it
209,102888761.7,Edgwired,then i'd want to go through and finalize the spacing
209,102888774,Other,no time for that in this case
209,102888785,Other,"well, how long would it take to finalize spacing?"
209,102888793.1,Edgwired,maybe a day
209,102888795.6,Edgwired,maybe two
209,102888817.8,Edgwired,not worth doing until were pretty much set on its content though
209,102888820.8,Edgwired,and as far as i know
209,102888825.2,Other,yeah
209,102888828.9,Other,so don't worry about it for now
209,102888829,Edgwired,we'll be printing it out here for the forseeable future
209,102888842.2,Other,if sam want's to spend money on 5000 or whatever
209,102888842.4,Edgwired,"cuz it's like 5,000 for 500 copies"
209,102888845.8,Edgwired,right
209,102888846.1,Other,that's his perogative
209,102888853.2,Edgwired,by the by
209,102888867.8,Edgwired,do you think we could actually compute how much we've spent on printing up to now
209,102888873.5,Edgwired,like come up with a real per page cost?
209,102888898.1,Other,yes
209,102888902.4,Other,i know the ink costs
209,102888906.7,Other,i know the paper costs
209,102888912.2,Other,well
209,102888916.5,Other,i ahve access to them
209,102888920.5,Edgwired,right
209,102888922.4,Edgwired,i'm thinking
209,102888922.5,Other,you are trying to see if it actually saves us money?
209,102888930.5,Edgwired,pretty much
209,102888937.8,Edgwired,sameer thinks it's 20 cents a page
209,102888947.2,Edgwired,and i'm thinking it's probably less than that
209,102888950.9,Other,"well,"
209,102888957.4,Other,how many pages does the printer say we have printed?
209,102888974.6,Other,"we just changed it at the 10,000 mark right?"
209,102888978.5,Edgwired,"well, i figured that there was a set amount for us to have printed when it needed that maintenance, so we could figure it off that"
209,102888980.6,Edgwired,Exactly
209,102888988.2,Edgwired,even include the cost of the maintenance
209,102888997.9,Other,200 for the mainenance... roughly
209,102889009.5,Other,figure about 500 for ink
209,102889024.3,Edgwired,so maybe 10 cents a page?
209,102889041.4,Other,you have to figure in that expensive ass paper
209,102889049.4,Edgwired,Ha
209,102889054.2,Edgwired,the glossy paper?
209,102889056.4,Other,yeah
209,102889063.4,Edgwired,that we pay fucking $40 for 200 sheets?
209,102889076,Other,right
209,102889082.3,Other,$0.20 per
209,102889087.1,Edgwired,man
209,102889102.1,Edgwired,we could get the paper cheaper though right?
209,102889113,Other,might be able to cut that in half
209,102889125.9,Other,so you are talking $20 per
209,102889127.6,Other,err
209,102889129.7,Other,.20 per
209,102889132.4,Other,brochure
209,102889139.8,Edgwired,right
209,102889148.4,Edgwired,"ok, well at least i have a good idea"
209,102889155.3,Edgwired,for when i print proofs
209,102889184.9,Other,i'd say that you can be comfortable with <0.40 estimate
209,102889190.2,Other,per
209,102889194.3,Other,for color
209,102889205,Edgwired,that's a lot to me
209,102889215.2,Edgwired,printing should be like 5-10 per page
209,102889216.4,Edgwired,ideally
209,102889235.3,Edgwired,i mean
209,102889238.8,Edgwired,wtf do i know
209,102889253,Other,well
209,102889260.7,Other,we could get ink costs down by getting aftermarket
209,102889283.6,Other,we need to monitor the stripe issue
209,102889313.8,Edgwired,i don't see us paying $10 a copy to have the qrg printed elsewhere
209,102889338.9,Edgwired,i guess it costs us like $10 though
209,102889339,Other,depends on the quantity
209,102889349.9,Other,how do you figure that?
209,102889355.7,Edgwired,48 pages
209,102889357.8,Other,right
209,102889358.7,Edgwired,*.2
209,102889376.3,Other,24 pieces of paper
209,102889396.2,Edgwired,two sides?
209,102889402.9,Other,right
209,102889411.9,Other,"so, the first side and the paper is .2"
209,102889417.5,Other,the additional side... 0.10
209,102889447,Other,so its like $7.50
209,102889456.7,Edgwired,k
209,102889463.4,Other,but this is all estimating
209,102889804.8,Edgwired,brb

212,102970668.4,Edgwired,let it be stupid
212,102970687.4,Other,"right,, but your problem with it is that it's really elementary"
212,102970688.3,Other,right?
212,102970694,Edgwired,no
212,102970700.2,Edgwired,my problem is that it's not written as instructions

212,102970725.2,Other,In order to save this letter you will need to click on the Files button on the upper left hand side of the screen.

212,102970771.3,Other,Click on the <<FILES BUTTON IMAGE>> to save your letter.
212,102970805.2,Edgwired,"I would change things like ""Now you will notice that the sentence ""Practicing saving and opening files."" Is on the page? Congratulations you have successfully saved and opened a file."
212,102970820.8,Edgwired,Now you will notice is strictly a spoken reference
212,102970827.9,Other,right
212,102970837.8,Other,i agree
212,102970868.5,Edgwired,for one thing
212,102970885.2,Edgwired,"addressing the audience as ""You"" is pretty bad in and of itself"
212,102970899.1,Edgwired,w.e
212,102970899.1,Other,"The sentence ""Practicing saving and opening files."" now appears on the screen. Congratulations, you have successfully saved and opened a file."

212,102970919.6,Edgwired,sure
212,102970922,Other,"don't tell me whatever, i am asking your for help"
212,102970922.2,Edgwired,problem is
212,102970934,Edgwired,the whole thing is written that way
212,102970937.3,Other,i know
212,102970937.5,Edgwired,so
212,102970942.7,Edgwired,if you want to leave it the way it is
212,102970943,Other,I will re-write it
212,102970945,Edgwired,that's fine with me
212,102970957.9,Other,i just want to figure out what the best way to have it re-written
212,102970965,Edgwired,what you just did
212,102970967.5,Other,ok
212,102970982.7,Other,yeah... i totally agree with you... it's lame that he wrote that as if he was speaking to an old lady
212,102970997.3,Edgwired,i'm sure that's exactly the way it goes in class
212,102971001.5,Other,it needs to be more general and worded the same as in the quick reference guide
212,102971007.4,Other,ok
212,102971008.3,Other,brb

221,103144070.3,Other,why is yellow so good

221,103144386.8,Edgwired,at least
221,103144392,Edgwired,and royalty free
221,103144405.5,Edgwired,its' not findable on the web
221,103144419.7,Edgwired,this is what we have to use

221,103144467.9,Edgwired,"when we started doing this, i looked at 3000 pictures of kites"
221,103144473.4,Edgwired,i found maybe 4 that worked
221,103144482.6,Edgwired,and they told me that i had to figure it out for free
221,103144494.9,Other,we spent $60 dollars on a fucking kite
221,103144505.9,Other,at the time you were giving the option of a very expensive image
221,103144509.5,Edgwired,instead of $5000 for the picture
221,103144512.3,Other,right
221,103144523.5,Other,the image i just sent you is reasonably priced
221,103144558.3,Edgwired,$180?
221,103144563.5,Other,yeah

221,103144717.8,Edgwired,"i was told they're ""Too much like MSN"
221,103144741.7,Other,the entire idea is too much like msn
221,103144769.1,Edgwired,i'm just saying what i heard
221,103144772.1,Other,i know
221,103144784.3,Edgwired,i did go through all of these pictures
221,103144788.2,Other,ok

221,103144809.1,Other,airbrush one ;)
221,103144832.8,Edgwired,i just spent the last 20 minutes thinking about painting one over the weekend
222,103144951,Other,is there another idea we could use?
222,103144958.7,Other,this is taking entirely way too much time and effort
222,103144965.5,Edgwired,"i tried to talk to them about that yesterday and they were like, ""No.:"
222,103144974.9,Other,who did you talk to
222,103144985.2,Other,do you have any other ideas already?
222,103144987,Edgwired,"Sameer launched into a ""this should have been done weeks ago"" rather than actually discussing what we should do"
222,103145013.4,Edgwired,my only ideas were to get rid of at least one of the things
222,103145015.6,Edgwired,either the grass
222,103145016.9,Edgwired,or the kit
222,103145019.9,Edgwired,or the chair
222,103145035.4,Other,i've seen teh grass
222,103145036.9,Edgwired,we own a picture that we could use
222,103145038,Other,it looks like grass
222,103145041.1,Other,which one?
222,103145053.5,Edgwired,the old people sitting with the picnic basket in the grass
222,103145059.7,Other,fuck it
222,103145060.8,Edgwired,but Jason is dead set on the kite
222,103145062.9,Other,why don't we use that
222,103145067.4,Other,alright
222,103145068.1,Other,well
222,103145071.5,Other,i have nothing further then
222,103145076.7,Edgwired,exactly
222,103145078.5,Other,the kite is too difficult
222,103145085.4,Other,you can't make one from stratch
222,103145091.8,Other,and expect it to look like its flying
222,103145107.9,Edgwired,the direction i was giving
222,103145109.2,Edgwired,was
222,103145122.8,Edgwired,"put something together no matter WHAT it looks like, and we can talk about it then"
222,103145128.7,Other,yes
222,103145129.9,Other,do that
222,103145130.9,Other,asap
222,103145136.1,Other,just slap the bitch together
222,103145143.3,Edgwired,i'm trying
222,103145144.2,Other,its not worth putting lots of time into it
222,103145162.2,Other,we need another idea
222,103145165.3,Other,that's the problem
222,103145173.6,Edgwired,plan b
222,103145178.4,Edgwired,is exactly what i asked for
222,103145179.4,Edgwired,i said
222,103145182.2,Edgwired,if this doesn't work
222,103145183.8,Edgwired,then what
222,103145191.5,Edgwired,and it was
222,103145193.5,Edgwired,make it work
222,103145237.6,Edgwired,and really
222,103145251.4,Edgwired,i don't have any other good ideas
222,103145263.9,Edgwired,that don't involve what we've been doing
222,103145279.5,Other,what do you mean by that?
222,103145285.5,Other,that don't invole what we've been doing
222,103145294.9,Edgwired,i mean the only things i've been thinking about involve grass and kites and chairs
222,103145376.7,Other,ahh
222,103145561.8,Edgwired,http://www.caustik.com/cxbx/index.htm
222,103145574.5,Other,help me with this email...
222,103145579.3,Edgwired,k
222,103145585.5,Other,i am trying to explain why we are *fucked*
222,103145589,Other,in terms of the box
222,103145594.4,Other,"1. Kites cannot be made from scratch to look like they are real, much less flying. 2. Royalty FREE images ARE available, but have been ruled out because they: cost WAY too much (>$200), and the reasonably priced ones are either ""too much like MSN"". 3. We have rejected the option of having a ""Plan B""."
222,103145612.5,Edgwired,dude
222,103145614.8,Edgwired,leave it alone
222,103145616.5,Edgwired,seriously
222,103145619.1,Other,why?
222,103145619.5,Edgwired,i mean
222,103145622.2,Edgwired,i appreciate that
222,103145623.4,Other,this is ridiculous
222,103145628,Edgwired,but this has been going on for weeks
222,103145633.1,Edgwired,and it's going to cause huge problems
222,103145635.6,Other,ah
222,103145638.2,Other,grrrrrrrrrrrrr
222,103145759.7,Other,honestly
222,103145768.3,Other,the kite we have does not look like a traditional kite
222,103145772.7,Edgwired,i know
222,103145775.8,Edgwired,i pointed it out
222,103145786.4,Edgwired,he doesn't care
222,103145816,Other,cool
222,103145819.6,Other,alright
222,103145823.8,Other,slap it together
222,103145827.1,Other,what idiots
222,103145846,Edgwired,it would be a good idea if we had the money to do it easily
222,103145850.8,Other,yeah
222,103145852.9,Edgwired,but it's not a good idea trying to do it for nothing
222,103145854.3,Other,just buy the image
222,103145856.4,Edgwired,and it was my idea
222,103145865.6,Edgwired,and i don't think it's a great idea
222,103145987,Other,there should have been another idea that could have been executed without all this
222,103145992.1,Other,a picture of a rose
222,103145994.8,Other,or whatever
222,103146005.3,Edgwired,well
222,103146014.7,Edgwired,at least there should have been the willingness to accept it
222,103146022.8,Other,why don't we just go after a picture of a helicopter over a south american moutnain top with a real cougar inthe background
222,103146033.1,Other,draw that
222,103146041.1,Other,i don't think they get it
222,103146051,Edgwired,honestly
222,103146058.9,Edgwired,i can't comprehend where they're coming from
222,103146070.1,Edgwired,which is probably why this isn't working very well
222,103146079.4,Edgwired,and i'm sure the situation is mutual
222,103146087,Edgwired,because everytime i try to explain it
222,103146094.7,Other,you get told to just do it
222,103146098.6,Edgwired,my explanation basically gets ignored
222,103146109.9,Other,help me write it
222,103146112.5,Edgwired,it's my fault
222,103146117.7,Edgwired,because i'm still trying to do it
222,103146125,Edgwired,seriously
222,103146137.2,Edgwired,it's not going to accomplish anything but pissing jason and sameer off
222,103146141.2,Edgwired,they already *know*
222,103146164.2,Other,ok
222,103146333.4,Other,"empty chair in background facing us.. string from chair to kite in foreground, large enough to put SimpleC logo on one wing"
222,103146338,Other,is that the idea?
222,103146343.5,Edgwired,ha
222,103146349.3,Edgwired,i knew nothing about SimpleC on the wing
222,103146353.7,Other,i just made it up
222,103146365,Other,thought i would throw that into the mix
222,103146566.5,Other,can we hang in office and use fan ?
222,103146586.6,Edgwired,been done
222,103146591.9,Edgwired,sans fan
222,103146602,Other,mit fan could be better?
222,103146632.6,Edgwired,no idea

222,103148499.4,Other,werd
222,103148694.3,Edgwired,this isn't going to work
222,103148700.4,Other,the kite?
222,103148705.2,Edgwired,yes
222,103148708.8,Other,i'm telling you
222,103148712.4,Other,just slap the bitch on there
222,103149125.8,Edgwired,that's the only one that looks even remotely correct
222,103149128.8,Edgwired,as far as position
222,103149177.4,Other,all i can tell you is put it on there and let them see how bad it is

237,103648500,Edgwired,"if it's monetary, we'll talk"

237,103648559.7,Edgwired,"ok einstein, lets see if you can you can divine what they look like"
237,103648573.1,Edgwired,how about a description
237,103648573.8,Edgwired,?
237,103648577.8,Edgwired,there's a picture
237,103648579.7,Other,"well, i'm assuming they all three have the image you purchased?"
237,103648580.7,Edgwired,in the background
237,103648584.5,Edgwired,and there's some text
237,103648586.6,Edgwired,in fact
237,103648591,Edgwired,on two out of three
237,103648605.4,Edgwired,there is all of the text that sameer wanted
237,103648612.8,Edgwired,how about them apples?
237,103648616.8,Other,that doesn't necessarily make me happy
237,103648625.6,Other,but i'm sure he'll be satisfied
237,103648638.4,Other,"actually... he'll just say.. ""that's how it should be"
237,103648647.1,Other,"it should have been done 6 years ago"
237,103648649.3,Other,or some shit
237,103648657.4,Other,but i'll just settle to see how they look
237,103648660.8,Other,and be quite happy with that
237,103648676.8,Other,i'm anxious to see what you have done with that picture
237,103648690.8,Other,because it seemed like it had a lot of potential
237,103648695.5,Other,and that was just from my brain
237,103648705.6,Edgwired,hmmm
237,103648710.7,Edgwired,maybe as a compromise
237,103648714.5,Edgwired,i'll show you something else
237,103648721.6,Other,nah nah nah... come on
237,103648729.9,Other,there's nothing to lose
237,103648751.3,Edgwired,we lose the anticipation
237,103648756.4,Edgwired,probably the best thing of all
237,103648756.4,Other,not at all
237,103648792.2,Other,"it'll be a nice introduction into the ""first drafts review process"
237,103648851.5,Edgwired,here's what you're getting:
237,103648864,Edgwired,i'll send you one of the three brochure covers i did
237,103648903.7,Edgwired,think of it as a sort of trailer
237,103649181.7,Other,i really like that picture
237,103649188.2,Edgwired,as do i
237,103649214,Other,box fronts please
237,103649228.9,Edgwired,main non
237,103649246.7,Other,i hope that means yes
237,103649258.7,Other,here come the files
237,103649307.7,Edgwired,this girl has amazing taste in music
237,103649317.3,Edgwired,and a fat pipe
237,103649320.6,Edgwired,what more could you ask for
237,103649330.6,Other,this cover for the brochure cannot be produced on our printer
237,103649340.6,Edgwired,how come?
237,103649345.8,Other,"well,,, for distribution anyway"
237,103649351.9,Other,because it uses too much color
237,103649379.1,Edgwired,i suppose that's why there is more than one version
237,103649383.6,Edgwired,although
237,103649386.5,Edgwired,i find it odious
237,103649398.6,Other,odi was a happy dog
237,103649422.4,Edgwired,odi wasn't arbitrarily restrained from genius
237,103649440.9,Other,i didn't say anything about restraint
237,103649455.7,Other,its a great cover to order from a printer
237,103649483.4,Other,another point.....
237,103649520.9,Other,maybe that restraint then provides grounds for even greater genius
237,103649530.4,Edgwired,bullshit
237,103649537.1,Other,IF there were any restraint at all
237,103649537.2,Edgwired,that's the problem we had with the box in the first place
237,103649539.1,Other,which there isn't
237,103649563.9,Other,the box is a huge bitching issue
237,103649567.3,Other,on both sides
237,103649578.5,Other,myself excluded at the moment
237,103649580.8,Edgwired,"well, just so you know, i'm not wrong"
237,103649586.5,Edgwired,in case you were wondering
237,103649591,Other,its not about right or wrong
237,103649595,Other,its about expectations
237,103649601.8,Other,not being met on either side
237,103649630.6,Edgwired,damn you madonna
237,103649638.3,Edgwired,crashed a fucking again
237,103649662.5,Edgwired,i think i shall have to resort to more urbane climes
237,103649679.1,Edgwired,"on the plus side, my shpongle is coming through"
237,103649684.6,Other,ha
237,103649721.3,Other,"well,, check this out"
237,103649739.9,Other,I had a big heated conversation with scott and sameer the other day

237,103649801.2,Edgwired,did you come to a conclusions?
237,103649810.5,Other,and regardless of who points fingers where
237,103649817.6,Other,we all agreed we need to get stuff done quicker
237,103649830.6,Other,i made some points about resources and their availability
237,103649837,Other,people and their availability
237,103649846.6,Other,and the mis-direction
237,103649850.9,Other,on and on and on
237,103649861.1,Other,in the end
237,103649871.4,Other,organization is the only solution
237,103649874.3,Other,as always
237,103649880.6,Other,"but,"
237,103649881.7,Other,this time

237,103649892.5,Other,in terms of
237,103649899.8,Other,telling jason and sameer and scott to step off
237,103649902.5,Other,when i need to
237,103649911.8,Other,or when they begin to hinder productivity
237,103649914.8,Edgwired,dun dun dun
237,103649922.2,Edgwired,don't let it go to your head
237,103649923.7,Other,i was actually instructed to do so
237,103649926.1,Other,right
237,103649928.3,Other,i could care less
237,103649939.6,Other,it is just a difference in how i react to them slowing our company down
237,103649947.9,Other,which is the proper perspective
237,103649961.3,Other,vs my previous.... well they are just slowing their company down
237,103649968.3,Other,which was my fault
237,103649970.5,Other,at any rate
237,103650011.6,Other,I'd like to have more review (preview) processes built into most company projects
237,103650063.5,Other,"while, I don't necessarily need to see anything right now... I don't see how it would upset the process any.... and I actually believe it could only help..."
237,103650071.7,Other,what do you think?
237,103650086.6,Edgwired,"i was in the middle of typing, ""as long as they don't include the box"
237,103650089.2,Edgwired,:)
237,103650093.1,Other,your an ass
237,103650095.2,Other,you know that don't you
237,103650101.2,Edgwired,YES
237,103650101.9,Edgwired,.
237,103650104.1,Other,good
237,103650108.1,Other,that's the only way to be
237,103650147.8,Other,why is the box such a touchy issue?
237,103650156.1,Edgwired,no touchy
237,103650167.5,Other,"well, non-compliant issue"
237,103650175.9,Edgwired,mostly because it's fun
237,103650180.7,Edgwired,and because
237,103650186.8,Edgwired,i want to print them out
237,103650192.4,Edgwired,because i can't tell what they look like
237,103650196.2,Edgwired,on screen
237,103650212.6,Other,i understand that... and i'm not going to stop you from printing anything
237,103650214.1,Edgwired,so printing is the real preview
237,103650227.8,Other,"well, i'm less critical of screen vs print"
237,103650228,Edgwired,and
237,103650230.9,Edgwired,really
237,103650235.3,Edgwired,to keep the creative process holy
237,103650263.9,Other,so you can finish the ideas before you get feedback on them?
237,103650268,Edgwired,yes
237,103650277.2,Other,what if I vow not to give feedback
237,103650284.2,Other,non whatsoever
237,103650306.7,Edgwired,you're going to hate this answer
237,103650313.8,Edgwired,but
237,103650316.3,Edgwired,that's not possible
237,103650322.5,Edgwired,because whether or not you say anything
237,103650324.4,Edgwired,you still think it
237,103650329,Edgwired,and thereby influence the process
237,103650340.9,Other,you're that easily influenced?
237,103650342.7,Edgwired,karma is a bitch
237,103650346.4,Other,ha
237,103650361,Edgwired,"no, dan, i'm just a sensitive kind of guy"
237,103650377.9,Other,alright
237,103650403.9,Other,we are going to work on setting review deadlines
237,103650408.5,Other,so there isn't this misunderstanding
237,103650411.9,Edgwired,k
237,103650420.8,Edgwired,my review deadline for the box was when Jason gets back
237,103650427.5,Other,right
237,103650437.9,Edgwired,so from my point of view i'm sticking to the deadline
237,103650441.7,Other,right
237,103650454.4,Edgwired,k
237,103650457.7,Edgwired,i'm not usually late
237,103650461.7,Other,if we are going to be an inflexible beaurocratic bitch of a company
237,103650464,Edgwired,with many things
237,103650481.9,Other,ok... that was my last shot
237,103650484.9,Edgwired,ha
237,103650487.5,Edgwired,and i'm spent
237,103650501.5,Other,pretty much
237,103650512,Other,i just like to acclerate things
237,103650529.6,Other,"because, unless you haven't noticed.... we still aren't making any money"
237,103650534.9,Edgwired,TRUE
237,103650535.9,Edgwired,but
237,103650537.9,Edgwired,not my issue
237,103650544.4,Other,it is everyone's issue
237,103650549.9,Edgwired,i disagree
237,103650550.6,Other,you own part of the company as well
237,103650553,Edgwired,it's marketing's issue
237,103650560.7,Other,there you go
237,103650561.7,Edgwired,i do what i do the best i can do it
237,103650562.2,Other,box needed
237,103650570.2,Edgwired,given what i have
237,103650582,Other,and the circumstances dealt
237,103650590.2,Edgwired,"and on this particular thing, i'm not giving in"
237,103650591.8,Edgwired,because
237,103650592.7,Other,beleive me.. .i've preached that a lot
237,103650606.4,Edgwired,the box is going nowhere until the fools return from San Francisco
237,103650611.6,Other,and the conclusion was drawn as
237,103650626.9,Other,"Do something about it, it is your job, take it as your responsiblity and make changes"
237,103650643.1,Other,so it is entirely on my shoulders now
237,103650647,Edgwired,the box?
237,103650651.4,Edgwired,or everything in general?
237,103650668.6,Other,"well, let's agree on after they get back i guess, since that was said before this was established"
237,103650686.1,Other,"managing in general, yes"
237,103650690.4,Other,not vision
237,103650690.9,Other,or direction
237,103650697.7,Edgwired,you're in charge?
237,103650701.7,Other,yes
237,103650710.8,Other,if i need resources
237,103650714,Other,i have to make them happen
237,103650728.1,Other,"if something i'm a part of doesn't get done, it is my fault"
237,103650752,Other,because i didn't make the necessary events occur
237,103650766.4,Edgwired,at some point
237,103650769.4,Edgwired,in the near future
237,103650787.6,Edgwired,"i hope we quit changing how things get done, because I have trouble keeping up"
237,103650796.2,Other,i agree
237,103650820.7,Other,i think this was a failure on my part just as much as anyone... because prior to now i have been giving excuses as answers for delays
237,103650837.4,Other,"like... well, this person wasn't available, or whatever"
237,103650849.8,Edgwired,what you've described to me still isn't a functional heirarchy
237,103650868.1,Other,what is
237,103650871.1,Other,and why not
237,103650905.7,Edgwired,the roles of the managers are not defined in such a way that information is centralized
237,103650936.7,Other,how so?
237,103650987.3,Edgwired,"on a purely operational level, who's telling who to do what in which case isn't at all clear"
237,103651072.7,Edgwired,"as it relates to me, there isn't any defined person that i can work with to make decisions"
237,103651090.4,Edgwired,and it works soooo much better if there is only one person
237,103651092.9,Other,"i meet with 3, i get vision and direction, i execute, meaning I tell whomever I need to whatever i need to get done"
237,103651099.9,Other,you get decisions from me
237,103651111.7,Other,whether or not it has to be finally reviewed by others
237,103651115.5,Edgwired,that isn't what Jason and I discussed
237,103651118.1,Other,the decision will come from me
237,103651214.2,Edgwired,"i have enough experience doing this that i know that my job only works when i've got a direct line to whoever is making the final, FINAL decision"
237,103651229.4,Edgwired,because otherwise we run around in circles
237,103651232.7,Edgwired,doing stupid shit
237,103651249.5,Edgwired,so if there's a vision
237,103651255.1,Edgwired,i need to hear it directly
237,103651259.3,Edgwired,because that's what i work with
237,103651300.1,Other,i don't disagree necessarily
237,103651316,Other,and... that point will be brought up
237,103651328.1,Edgwired,i've brought it up with Jason
237,103651334.9,Edgwired,and to my knowledge he understands this
237,103651339.2,Other,right
237,103651344.9,Edgwired,so i don't know where Sameer and Scott fit into it
237,103651379.2,Other,the only solution is for you or me to talk with them about it
237,103651399.5,Edgwired,"if you're talking about you managing me and Gonzo, because that's all there is right now, then i think it's silly because it's really you managing Gonzo, which is silly"
237,103651429.2,Other,its coordination
237,103651430.7,Edgwired,in a larger organization this might make sense
237,103651436.8,Other,alright
237,103651438,Other,"well,"
237,103651445.1,Other,the company is completely failing to meet deadlines
237,103651447.2,Other,everyone included
237,103651450.6,Other,that is the problem
237,103651461.4,Other,and nobody takes responsibility
237,103651465,Other,they point fingers
237,103651474.7,Other,you say that its jason and other fault for insisting on kite
237,103651481.4,Other,they say its you being a bottleneck
237,103651490.2,Other,I point out everything
237,103651496.3,Other,that i can think of
237,103651499.3,Other,that causes the problem
237,103651523.1,Edgwired,i am absolutely not responsible for the delivery date of this box
237,103651532.4,Edgwired,when it was such an emergency to have
237,103651536.8,Edgwired,we didn't have the money to print it
237,103651539.2,Edgwired,and the date slipped
237,103651540.3,Edgwired,and then
237,103651544.8,Edgwired,Beryl was going to print it
237,103651547.8,Edgwired,and the date slipped
237,103651553.1,Edgwired,and now it's this conference
237,103651555.3,Edgwired,so PLEASE
237,103651559.9,Edgwired,take that back
237,103651569.8,Edgwired,because i GET my shit done on TIME
237,103651587.1,Edgwired,i don't arrange my priorities
237,103651591.8,Edgwired,THEY do
237,103651591.9,Other,I didn't say anything to the contrary
237,103651603,Other,i said nearly the exact same thing
237,103651619.7,Edgwired,well he can take that bottleneck shit and shove it up his ass
237,103651656.3,Other,the entire company needs to be more efficient
237,103651659,Other,the way the company works
237,103651660.5,Other,because
237,103651662.6,Other,it isn't
237,103651728.4,Edgwired,"this is entirely an organizational management issue, of which i have no one to manage, so the efficiencies are not going to be seen by harassing my work"
237,103651741.1,Other,i'm not harassing anything
237,103651764.9,Edgwired,i'm saying you're not going to get the art any faster than you ask for it
237,103651775.6,Other,right
237,103651802,Other,"and if we continue to throw projects into the mix at the last moment, then it will take even longer"
237,103651823.3,Edgwired,that's also organizational management
237,103651826.9,Other,right
237,103651829.4,Other,I agree
237,103651848.8,Other,that's why it makes sense to have a person planning all this shit and then managing it as well
237,103651878.6,Edgwired,"i hate to tell you this burciago, but you can't manage by proxy with those three"
237,103651905.9,Edgwired,you shouldn't be directly responsible for their bad decisions
237,103651913.1,Edgwired,they should
237,103651934.5,Other,right.....
237,103651957.1,Edgwired,esp when they're directly responsible for their good decisions
237,103651961.8,Edgwired,in any event
237,103651976.6,Other,TRUE
237,103651995.6,Other,but if they are focused on doing their individual tasks and need someone to coordinate
237,103651998.4,Other,then that should be possible
237,103652005.8,Other,as long as it is planned and communicated
237,103652006.6,Edgwired,so you're the COO?
237,103652021.2,Other,ha
237,103652022.2,Other,LOL
237,103652040.8,Other,"unless jason wants to be,,, which i don't think he does a good job of doing specific parts of that job"
237,103652067.1,Edgwired,but that's what i'm saying
237,103652069.6,Edgwired,either your
237,103652070.4,Edgwired,it
237,103652072.2,Edgwired,or you're not
237,103652073,Edgwired,not
237,103652078.6,Edgwired,only when Jason doesn't want to be
237,103652080.8,Other,i completely agree
237,103652092.6,Edgwired,so we still have a problem
237,103652111.4,Other,i think that if they want me to take that specific responsiblity of managing.. they need to give me the authority that goes along with it
237,103652114.8,Other,"otherwise, it doesn't work"
237,103652128.3,Other,"and personally, i have no ego driven attachment to the position"
237,103652161.4,Edgwired,in my mind it
237,103652162.5,Edgwired,'s
237,103652167.4,Edgwired,no good if it's unofficial
237,103652169.9,Edgwired,and really
237,103652172.6,Other,if he wants to be available everyday to ask you if you need resources and to coordinate what you are doing with others... then fine
237,103652186.7,Other,but i haven't seen him fully functional in that respect
237,103652194.1,Other,with the company as a whole
237,103652207.6,Other,"he's good for snap ""DO IT"" decisions"
237,103652225.7,Other,which some of the time contradict each other or other things in teh company
237,103652237.3,Other,"and in my opinion, hinder progression"
237,103652258.3,Other,even though it is sometimes perceived as moving the particular project forward
237,103652274.5,Other,EX.... making the QRG as short as possible....
237,103652281.8,Other,it was an IDIOTIC waste of time
237,103652291.1,Edgwired,ha
237,103652315.5,Edgwired,but what would it be like if you hadn't
237,103652316.2,Edgwired,?
237,103652322.2,Edgwired,it would be 80 pages
237,103652324.7,Edgwired,instead of 50
237,103652327.6,Other,no
237,103652344.5,Other,it would have been 50
237,103652371.1,Other,the majority of hte time spent was not the text
237,103652377.1,Edgwired,TRUE
237,103652384.6,Other,which is the only functional difference between onur's and yours
237,103652395.6,Edgwired,not true
237,103652395.7,Other,as a result of jason and my time spent
237,103652399.5,Edgwired,ok
237,103652402,Other,*qualifier
237,103652419.6,Other,we spent many many hours trying to scrunch
237,103652424,Other,which was STUPID
237,103652430.5,Other,i had already reviewed the text
237,103652436.1,Other,and revised
237,103652439.4,Other,from that point
237,103652442,Other,it should have gone to you
237,103652452,Other,that's the process
237,103652468.5,Other,"not,,, lets see if you and i can sit here and fuck with it to see if we can get it down to 5 pages"
237,103652475.8,Other,thereby making it utterly useless
237,103652487.7,Other,these sorts of inefficiencies are all over
237,103652498.4,Other,someone has to be appointed
237,103652501.6,Other,i don't care who it is
237,103652510.1,Edgwired,fine
237,103652512.1,Edgwired,but right now
237,103652515.8,Other,the box waits
237,103652516.8,Edgwired,that person still doesn't exist
237,103652521.5,Other,right
237,103652528.1,Other,i agree
237,103652542.8,Other,"they have tried to put me in that position, but without the necessary authority"
237,103652545.3,Other,is how i feel
237,103652566.4,Edgwired,i think you're a fool if you accept it that way
237,103652583.3,Other,"don't worry,,, it isn't a done deal yet"
237,103652594.7,Other,we have to wait until they get back
237,103652605.6,Edgwired,yes
237,103652607.9,Edgwired,so
237,103652610.6,Edgwired,what else is new
237,103652620.1,Other,"in the meantime,,, can i preview the box?"
237,103652623.2,Edgwired,Ha
237,103652627.6,Edgwired,yes
237,103652632.6,Other,nice!
237,103652752.6,Other,Adding another level of management without the ability to give a final decision only creates further inefficiencies in a company of this size.
237,103652767.3,Edgwired,ha
237,103652771.2,Other,i think that says it all
237,103652773.3,Edgwired,three layers of management for 10 people
237,103652775.3,Edgwired,is insane
237,103652790.3,Other,yeah
237,103652820.8,Other,i think they don't agree based on the fact that each of the three are busy enough with other things that they don't have sufficient time to manage
237,103652826.2,Other,do you think that is safe?
237,103652860.6,Edgwired,either sameer or jason should be managing
237,103652866.5,Edgwired,sameer isn't capable
237,103652868.4,Edgwired,Jason
237,103652874.3,Edgwired,needs someone else to do what he's doing
237,103652886.8,Edgwired,and only be a manager
237,103652901.7,Other,someone to take over business development
237,103652922.9,Edgwired,maybe in 20 years his ego would be secure enough to let someone else be in charge where he otherwise would
237,103652932.8,Edgwired,but not while his parent's cash is on the line
237,103652958.7,Other,which is ultimately screwing things up
237,103653035.4,Edgwired,you know what i learned with a Management Concentration at Wharton?
237,103653039.4,Other,?
237,103653044.6,Edgwired,let someone else do it
237,103653053.7,Other,;)
237,103653068.3,Other,delegate
237,103653092,Edgwired,"nah, it's more like, manage from the rear"
237,103653093.5,Edgwired,like
237,103653100.6,Edgwired,the President isn't really in charge

237,103653225.6,Other,"that doesn't make sense in light of as the president ""let someone else do it"
237,103653242,Other,which is exactly what they are trying to do
237,103653412.9,Edgwired,do you know what gonzo is doing with the website?
237,103653417.5,Edgwired,i think i may change that one page

237,103653444.5,Other,it isn't going anywhere until there is time for a comprehensive review... that's my understanding...
237,103653447.7,Other,which... could mean nothing

237,103653751.9,Edgwired,the text needs to be changed
237,103653757.8,Edgwired,and it could probably be recoded
237,103653784.4,Other,right
237,103653788.2,Other,but that isn't you
237,103653794.8,Edgwired,not me

237,103654506.2,Other,the paramaters are simply make the four options prominently displayed in a way that will spur people to try them
237,103654544.9,Other,"the only thing is, those four links at the moment could be interpreted to be just statements"
237,103654561.1,Edgwired,i am absolutely not turning them into buttons
237,103654573.5,Other,ok..
237,103654574.3,Other,why?
237,103654589.1,Edgwired,"until we move the site to flash, buttons are bad design"
237,103654609.2,Other,what is bad about them.... refresh me
237,103654623.9,Edgwired,for one thing
237,103654636.5,Edgwired,most reasonable designers don't use them anymore
237,103654648,Edgwired,when text serves the same purpose
237,103654654.3,Edgwired,at a smaller filesize
237,103654658.3,Edgwired,an image
237,103654685.2,Edgwired,won't improve the amount they stand out on the page
237,103654696.8,Edgwired,because it's still
237,103654698.3,Edgwired,text
237,103654708.5,Edgwired,laid on top of something useless
237,103654734.1,Edgwired,we have no pictures
237,103654742.7,Edgwired,that correctly identify the ideas
237,103654763.3,Other,right
237,103654767.5,Other,that was my hangup
237,103654778.2,Other,that tutorials didn't have appropriate images
237,103654794.7,Other,features we could use the 6 buttons
237,103654801,Other,email the email button
237,103654808.6,Other,but tutorials and have a look
237,103654811.2,Other,nothing
237,103654837.4,Edgwired,the only way to make those stand out
237,103654846.2,Edgwired,is to seperate them with descriptions
237,103654856.8,Other,one line each?
237,103654860,Edgwired,w/e
237,103654867.3,Edgwired,just so long as there is black text in between
237,103654869.9,Edgwired,images
237,103654870.8,Other,right
237,103654879.5,Edgwired,won't really improve the distictiveness
237,103654898.9,Other,"and not having ""simplec"" with the logo"
237,103654906.1,Other,no fix? no need?
237,103654911.1,Edgwired,fine the way it is
237,103654917.9,Edgwired,putting a logo
237,103654925.7,Edgwired,large enough to have the SimpleC with it
237,103654932,Edgwired,eats up too much real estate
237,103654935.6,Edgwired,to be useful
237,103654935.7,Other,yeah
237,103654939.9,Other,agreed
237,103654948.1,Other,and the entire site preaches simplec
237,103654955.8,Other,and the logo should be strong enough to stand on its own
237,103654959,Other,that's why its a logo
237,103654963.4,Edgwired,right
237,103654996.1,Other,contact page
237,103655005.2,Edgwired,?
237,103655013.2,Other,there are too many option in my opinion

237,103655054.8,Other,its roughly the same thing
237,103655055,Edgwired,either way

237,103655116.4,Other,haha

237,103655445.8,Other,have simplec mailed to you or a friend
237,103655464.6,Edgwired,FIne
237,103655476.3,Other,what do you think?

237,103655519.4,Edgwired,right
237,103655618.9,Other,i maintain that the about us page is awkard looking
237,103655629.3,Edgwired,it could be better
237,103655648.1,Edgwired,i'm thinking of ditching the italics and making the quotes smaller
237,103655656,Other,yeqh
237,103655658.2,Edgwired,maybe bringing them in line
237,103655660.8,Other,something

237,103658020.7,Other,but i understand uniformity
237,103658054.9,Edgwired,problem is there are three types of quotes on the page
237,103658059.3,Other,right
237,103658084.1,Other,i also think that we need text for all publication quotes
237,103658088.2,Other,not just links
237,103658097.5,Other,or text as in the case of milestones and curious parents
237,103658118.1,Other,do you agree?

258,104344507.3,Edgwired,on the about page

270,104864639.2,Other,if i have a set of music on my ipod
270,104864643.2,Other,that isn't on my itunes
270,104864652.5,Other,will that set be overwritten when i sync?
270,104864670.4,Edgwired,theoretically
270,104864672.8,Edgwired,when something syncs
270,104864677,Edgwired,it picks the newest date
270,104864680.4,Edgwired,of whatever happened
270,104864682.5,Edgwired,so if you add files
270,104864686.5,Edgwired,they should show up in iTunes
270,104864688.2,Other,yeah
270,104864688.9,Edgwired,but
270,104864696.2,Edgwired,i don't know what the real policy is
270,104864701.2,Edgwired,as far as DRM is concerned
270,104864704.5,Edgwired,only thing you can do
270,104864705.7,Edgwired,is try it
270,104864715.8,Other,"and if its gone, i'll just get it from you again"

270,104864738.9,Other,space issue
270,104864741.6,Other,but i'll figure it out
270,104865222,Other,"when i print out letters using the letterhead, there are little dots about half way into the page"
270,104865306.7,Other,and i also had a question about the taper on the right hand side of the black stripe.. it tapers in as you move towards the top
270,104865338.7,Edgwired,has it always been like that?
270,104865346.8,Other,i believe so
270,104865371.9,Edgwired,then it's probably supposed to do that
270,104865381.1,Edgwired,i dunno about the dots
270,104865391.4,Other,aight
270,104865415.4,Edgwired,do you see the smile?

270,104865447.4,Other,one in white at the top of the black stripe
270,104865454,Other,and the one that goes inhto the text
270,104865466.3,Edgwired,the second one is not where the dots are?
270,104865471.7,Other,yes
270,104865483.9,Other,the dots extend as far as the second smile
270,104865490.6,Edgwired,might be the quality at which you are printing it
270,104865529.1,Edgwired,also might be the quality of the graphic inlaid into the template
270,104865544.4,Edgwired,show it to me the next time we see each other
270,104865547.5,Other,alright

270,104865725.6,Other,i know
270,104865753,Other,do you think stationary is important
270,104865756.3,Other,worth the money

272,104940127.5,Edgwired,k
272,104940132.3,Other,do you think it would be best to continue use of bmp
272,104940138.6,Other,or use a jpg or gif
272,104940153.7,Edgwired,are you constrained by file size?
272,104940227.4,Other,no
272,104940232.8,Other,i don't think so anyway
272,104940237.3,Edgwired,doesn't make a difference then

272,104940245.6,Other,usually they are large batches of the same form
272,104940263.3,Other,they are timesheets that get printed for all summmer weeks
272,104940287.1,Edgwired,it might print faster if you switched to gif
272,104940298.6,Other,is bmp better quality?
272,104940303.9,Edgwired,eh
272,104940319.8,Edgwired,i don't think bitmap compresses the image

273,104945033.8,Other,"Ms. Wintering,  First, as written in the SEMS Overview, SEMS Coordinators do not have the ability to create job descriptions. The role of the SEMS Coordinator, as described in the Overview, is ""...simply to monitor and approve their department's work-study supervisors and jobs. This role was created in order to provide departments with added visibility and control over funds allocated towards the work-study program.""Second, in order to become a SEMS Coordinator, you must complete the SEMS Access Request Form, available in the Coordinator Login section under ""How to Apply"". Simply print out this form and return it to our office via mail or fax. Finally, the SEMS Access Request Form is intentionally a hard copy form so as to provide us with records of both Coordinator and Business Administrator signatures. Please let me know if you have any further questions. I have included website addresses below for your reference."

281,105303916.3,Other,i mean

281,105303950.6,Edgwired,right

281,105303977.4,Other,"putting all the files in one folder, not separated by artist"

281,105304367.4,Other,the point is that they don't let you go the other way
281,105304370.1,Other,no matter what
281,105304391.3,Edgwired,"i think this might, because it's date-based"
281,105304413.3,Edgwired,maybe not though
281,105304419.3,Edgwired,they might just be talking about the calendar

281,105304510.8,Other,but the dumbass software would make _1.mp3 extensions on the names
281,105304516.8,Other,instead of prompting for delete
281,105304525.5,Other,which was infuriating
281,105304529.8,Edgwired,heh

281,105304550.1,Other,iPod Agent

291,105462415,Edgwired,still tutorials

291,105462431.3,Other,just have it as an option tho

291,105462517.8,Other,i know
291,105462528,Other,the only way we could spin that
291,105462548,Other,is if we listed all the programs that are included in simplec

291,105462551.2,Other,flash
291,105462552.7,Other,ie

308,106593782.8,Edgwired,"if you only talk to him like once a month, it's not that bad"
308,106593786.4,Other,yeah
308,106593790.5,Other,that's been my tactic
308,106593809.6,Other,i don't even care to see him outside of work at this point
308,106593812.9,Other,much less at work
308,106593824.6,Edgwired,i usually enjoy him socially
308,106593831.9,Edgwired,but i can not stand the yelling
308,106594010.2,Other,yeah
308,106594012.7,Other,seriously
308,106594017.6,Other,the entire whining attitude
308,106594034,Other,i have enjoyed his company socially before...
308,106594057.1,Other,but anymore I cannot keep the work experiences out of my mind
308,106594122.5,Edgwired,he wouldn't exist in my world if he weren't paying for it

308,106594137.8,Other,well...

308,106594255.4,Edgwired,the rest of my options vest in two weeks
308,106594262.2,Edgwired,less than
308,106594267,Other,werd
308,106594286.1,Edgwired,i'm wondering if we're going to renegotiate
308,106594293.8,Other,renegotiate what?
308,106594298.5,Other,your pay?
308,106594307.2,Edgwired,the contract in general
308,106594329,Other,i think project basis is best
308,106594333.7,Edgwired,i don't
308,106594339.7,Edgwired,specifically
308,106594340.7,Edgwired,because
308,106594367.9,Edgwired,"i often i'm waiting on things i don't control to get a project finished, and would therefore be waiting on things i can't control to get paid"
308,106594411.1,Edgwired,if they want to change it to a project basis i might as well work for someone who will pay the rate that most people get for projects like these on a schedule that's reasonable
308,106594443.7,Other,yep
308,106594494.4,Edgwired,so you think it would be better to look for other work?
308,106594520.5,Other,that is entirely up to you
308,106594543.3,Edgwired,"yeah, but you have more information than i do"
308,106594555,Other,not really

308,106594594.2,Edgwired,good
308,106594596.6,Edgwired,because
308,106594602.6,Edgwired,although you can't tell
308,106594606.8,Edgwired,i really like the way things are
308,106594628.3,Edgwired,the bullshit isn't really more than anywhere else
308,106594635.1,Edgwired,and the work is ideal
308,106594639.2,Edgwired,and the flexibility is ideal
308,106594661.5,Other,the only thing that i see happening more often than i think is digestable is your stubbornness with certain issues
308,106594668.4,Edgwired,HAha
308,106594675.7,Edgwired,Daniel Frank and I talked about this
308,106594677.7,Other,that's about as frank as it gets
308,106594678.6,Edgwired,a lot actually
308,106594703.5,Other,many times you have good reasons
308,106594714.8,Other,and when explained... i think you sway more than you think
308,106594725.7,Edgwired,oh sure
308,106594730.2,Other,other times your just stubborn as shit
308,106594744.4,Edgwired,not as stubborn as you think
308,106594746.4,Edgwired,because really
308,106594749.2,Edgwired,that's just a front
308,106594751.7,Other,right
308,106594753.1,Edgwired,so i can decide
308,106594755.8,Edgwired,but
308,106594756.3,Other,and i know it is
308,106594759.4,Other,but others don't
308,106594759.5,Edgwired,it's sort of built in
308,106594761.1,Edgwired,you know?
308,106594767.1,Edgwired,instinctual
308,106594771.1,Other,and they are put off by it more
308,106594773,Edgwired,will probably change
308,106594777.2,Edgwired,as i get too old to argue
308,106594779.1,Edgwired,much
308,106594781.1,Edgwired,or care
308,106594783.6,Other,right
308,106594791.3,Other,you should care a bit less about what you do for SSI
308,106594799.7,Other,in my opinion
308,106594805.3,Edgwired,yeah
308,106594809.6,Edgwired,we're getting there
308,106594813.7,Other,not like lower quality work
308,106594846.4,Other,just not feeling that the website or brochure or whatever... is static and on display in the M. Edgcumbe gallery... open for critique by the worlds artists
308,106594857.1,Edgwired,ha
308,106594869.4,Edgwired,other half of that is it's what i'm going to use to try to get into art school
308,106594871,Edgwired,so in a sense
308,106594872.5,Edgwired,it really is
308,106594876.9,Other,right
308,106594886.1,Other,but
308,106594893.5,Other,you could also submit other versions
308,106594912.9,Other,"this is the version I was told to make by the jackass employer..... THIS is what I thought it should be"
308,106594914.6,Edgwired,i still keep the concepts
308,106594936.2,Edgwired,nothing gets developed as much as the actual product though
308,106594944.8,Other,right
308,106594953.2,Other,but when it comes to making a rollover or not
308,106594969.1,Edgwired,HAHaha
308,106594977.2,Other,right?
308,106594981.8,Edgwired,yeah
308,106594982.9,Other,you get the point
308,106594984.5,Edgwired,definitely
308,106594993.1,Edgwired,that's the kind of stuff
308,106594996.5,Edgwired,that i'm just fronting on
308,106594998,Other,because it doesn't speed anything up
308,106594998.2,Edgwired,because really
308,106595006.4,Edgwired,it doesn't make huge difference
308,106595014.9,Edgwired,although
308,106595019.1,Other,from a certain perspective
308,106595019.9,Edgwired,i wouldn't argue the point
308,106595024.6,Edgwired,as much
308,106595028.2,Edgwired,if i didn't think i was right
308,106595028.2,Other,add them all up and look at it from jason's perspective
308,106595033.8,Edgwired,jason
308,106595038.1,Edgwired,needs to leave my job to me
308,106595041.6,Edgwired,like he did originally
308,106595055.3,Other,if he wants a rollover
308,106595057.9,Edgwired,most of the things he wants
308,106595060.5,Edgwired,is arbitrary
308,106595062.5,Edgwired,and
308,106595066,Edgwired,even if it's small
308,106595067.2,Other,its up to him
308,106595068.8,Edgwired,most of the time
308,106595074.8,Other,at the end of the day
308,106595075.7,Edgwired,i've already thought about it and made a decision
308,106595087.9,Edgwired,and turning it into a big thing
308,106595090.8,Other,right
308,106595093.2,Edgwired,by discussing it over and over again
308,106595093.6,Other,my advice
308,106595099.4,Other,tell him that you've thought of it
308,106595100.4,Edgwired,really isn't going to change how i argue the point
308,106595103.4,Other,and why you don't want it
308,106595114.5,Other,give him the opportunity to see it from your perspective
308,106595121.7,Edgwired,the argument is really to guage how important it is to him
308,106595133.5,Other,that's not efficient
308,106595143.3,Edgwired,not really
308,106595150.7,Edgwired,but
308,106595151,Other,better to put your explanation out there
308,106595154.8,Edgwired,i do
308,106595156.4,Other,he does respect it
308,106595156.6,Edgwired,i have
308,106595160.1,Edgwired,we still argue
308,106595163.9,Other,hey
308,106595165.6,Edgwired,and
308,106595166.6,Other,if you put it out there
308,106595168.9,Other,and he still wants it
308,106595174.2,Edgwired,i'm not the only stubborn person
308,106595175.2,Edgwired,no?
308,106595176.9,Edgwired,takes two
308,106595178.6,Edgwired,to tango
308,106595183.9,Other,different positions
308,106595193.6,Other,you were just asking me about job security
308,106595203.3,Edgwired,yeah
308,106595207.4,Edgwired,but my attitude is that
308,106595217.2,Edgwired,i'm paid to make certain types of decisions
308,106595221.2,Edgwired,and that if they don't agree
308,106595225.2,Edgwired,then others can make them
308,106595232.8,Other,be certain in that
308,106595238.8,Edgwired,yup
308,106595240.1,Edgwired,i am
308,106595246.4,Other,because they see it as....
308,106595253.8,Other,you are paid to do what you do....
308,106595261.2,Other,and you are an employee of the company
308,106595270.8,Edgwired,haha
308,106595273.2,Edgwired,that's pretty funny
308,106595284.9,Edgwired,because
308,106595285.1,Other,and if they want something pink and purple
308,106595290.1,Other,then they should be able to get it
308,106595291.3,Edgwired,that's not the way the contract is written
308,106595303.6,Other,i understand your point
308,106595305.3,Edgwired,i'm a consultant
308,106595307.3,Other,i get both sides
308,106595309,Edgwired,i don't get benefits
308,106595326.9,Edgwired,i told Frank
308,106595327.5,Edgwired,that
308,106595478.8,Edgwired,"if they wanted to make me an employee with all that goes with that, and could afford a real salary, then i would be much more agreeable to showing up at the office every day and being less of an ass hole in general, but at this point, i'm getting out of it exactly what i want because that's the only thing that makes the compensation worth doing this."
308,106595498.6,Edgwired,i can't live in the city
308,106595501.3,Edgwired,so i work from home
308,106595505.9,Edgwired,i'm doing the art
308,106595509.7,Edgwired,so i can apply to grad school
308,106595562.5,Edgwired,esp since the stock options were written the way they are
308,106595573.7,Edgwired,they're not even being reasonable about that
308,106595576.2,Edgwired,so my opinion is
308,106595585.1,Other,they aren't going to take them back
308,106595588.2,Other,or anything like that
308,106595610.9,Edgwired,"they're not valuing my full attention, so they're not getting it"
308,106595616,Edgwired,if that was true
308,106595618.6,Other,valuing how?
308,106595619.6,Edgwired,then why write them
308,106595622.8,Edgwired,they way they have
308,106595634.5,Other,"they"" didn't write them"
308,106595643.6,Other,i'd suggest you talk to scott about it really
308,106595652.6,Edgwired,it doesn't concern me that much
308,106595653.6,Edgwired,because
308,106595655.9,Edgwired,i agree with you
308,106595656.7,Other,i talked to him about this and he has gone though them again
308,106595664.9,Edgwired,that it's not going to happen that way
308,106595665.5,Edgwired,but
308,106595674.3,Edgwired,it's not the language that counts
308,106595675.8,Edgwired,it's the tone
308,106595678.9,Edgwired,they set the tone
308,106595679.9,Other,i'd say
308,106595695.3,Other,that if all you want is a springboard into grad school.. fine
308,106595718.9,Other,i'd say if you are interested in working for SSI in the event things start to work out to the point that we are compensated correctly
308,106595729.1,Other,then you are not laying good groundwork for that
308,106595787.8,Edgwired,"the only thing i'm ever interested in is making sure that what i'm doing at the current moment satisfies my happiness... in my philosophy, everything else works itself out"
308,106595798,Other,that's good
308,106595803.9,Edgwired,so
308,106595804.3,Other,i completely respect it
308,106595808,Edgwired,i'm satisfied
308,106595813.5,Other,i think i have a good understanding of the situation
308,106595816.6,Other,and perspectives
308,106595823.7,Other,and have for a while
308,106595853.4,Other,its been a while since i was involved in a conversation on this topic with sameer involved
308,106595860.2,Other,and i told him
308,106595873.6,Other,that he is getting a fucking earth shattering deal
308,106595899.1,Other,he seemed to value being able to control what when how etc
308,106595906.8,Other,to which i told him
308,106595908.2,Other,fine
308,106595917,Other,go get another graphics designer...
308,106595925.6,Other,"and hell, i'll even help you find one"
308,106595930.5,Other,but you will be sorry
308,106595937.5,Edgwired,i deeply appreciate you speaking to him on my behalf
308,106595942.1,Other,and it is a stupid move
308,106595951.1,Edgwired,he should be speaking to me too
308,106595954.6,Other,it is in my best interest
308,106595963.7,Edgwired,"because every time i ask him, he says everything is find"
308,106595965.1,Edgwired,fine
308,106595967.8,Edgwired,and i DO ask him
308,106595972.4,Edgwired,i make a point of it
308,106595979.9,Other,maybe he's changed his mind
308,106595987.8,Other,i let him have it the last time this shit came up
308,106596011.8,Other,if he's to fucking arrogant and stubborn to see that i'm right
308,106596013.9,Other,fuck it
308,106596018,Edgwired,haha
308,106596030.7,Edgwired,not much you can do either way
308,106596033.6,Other,he wanted project basis
308,106596038,Other,i advised against that
308,106596051.4,Other,he's just a lil boy with a control problem
308,106596059.6,Other,a whiney brat
308,106596099.6,Other,i don't think about him
308,106596103,Other,i don't deal with him
308,106596108.6,Edgwired,"we should give him the benefit that he's got major amounts of pressure on him... like more that i would choose to deal with.. but, you're right that he really doesn't know how to maturely deal with it"
308,106596124.1,Other,i don't recognize him as a working part of anything i do with the company
308,106596128.3,Edgwired,ha
308,106596131.3,Edgwired,exactly
308,106596135.2,Other,i work with jason

309,106596943.3,Other,the screen measurement is diagonal
309,106596950,Edgwired,i know this
309,106596952.6,Edgwired,it's also on a stand
309,106596955.4,Edgwired,and

309,106596979.1,Other,put the projector in the cabinets
309,106597008.8,Edgwired,the screen would be 11 feet high
309,106597010.6,Other,and have it go about 10 feet
309,106597012.5,Other,diagonal
309,106597034,Other,so the height would be what?
309,106597038.5,Edgwired,11 feet
309,106597039.2,Other,we are talking 16:9

309,106597058.1,Edgwired,wait
309,106597060.8,Other,the height would be less than the diagonal
309,106597063.5,Other,numbnutz
309,106597075.4,Other,if i had a 10 foot diagonal
309,106597090.2,Edgwired,6 ffeet

309,106597139.7,Other,i have to do a lot of research
309,106597155.4,Other,but i really don't know why people don't do this instead of sets
309,106597189.1,Edgwired,um
309,106597191,Edgwired,back in the day
309,106597196.7,Edgwired,you couldn't use them for certain things
309,106597199.9,Edgwired,like video games
309,106597201.9,Other,i think its cause people like to watch tv with lights on

322,107192463.6,Other,all girls need their dose of drama
322,107192464.4,Edgwired,the abuse isn't going to be as bad
322,107192464.9,Other,for Marty McFly
322,107192466.7,Edgwired,but

322,107192484.1,Other,you see
322,107192486.2,Other,I think
322,107192489.5,Edgwired,yeah
322,107192493.3,Edgwired,she likes the torture of it
322,107192498.3,Edgwired,it puts pressure on her
322,107192503.2,Other,its a challenge
322,107192503.5,Edgwired,to act with her heart
322,107192507.6,Other,But she said that if i said stop she would
322,107192512,Other,lol]
322,107192518.3,Other,the funny thing is that I called all this to happen
322,107192522.8,Edgwired,ha
322,107192532.8,Edgwired,i think she would stop Tedi
322,107192533.5,Other,But whenever I got REAL close to some broad
322,107192533.7,Edgwired,but
322,107192543.4,Edgwired,i also think you don't want her to under those circumstances
322,107192546.4,Other,I would push it all away last second
322,107192549.5,Edgwired,she needs to take responsibility
322,107192565.4,Other,"Yeah, but Mikey you know where she goes with all of this?"
322,107192570.1,Other,"Me, motherfucker!"

322,107192662.4,Other,And am taking the responsibility for it
322,107192676.2,Other,That is why i told her that i dont want to jump back into it all again
322,107192683.8,Other,because she needs to do somehting like this
322,107192686.1,Other,good move
322,107192693.6,Other,in the chess sorta way
322,107192698.6,Other,but a lot of it is based on faith
322,107192701.7,Other,that in the end
322,107192713.1,Other,faith is for pussies
322,107192713.4,Other,My king will still be standing

322,107192785.8,Other,this person you never met
322,107192809.2,Other,What really made me mad was that the sex was in the room i used to live in
322,107192813.4,Other,and still sleep in
322,107192815.7,Edgwired,"yeah, i didn't like it when i heard that she told you that you HAD to accept her going to see TR"
322,107192826,Edgwired,because you didn't
322,107192833.2,Other,I know that
322,107192838.7,Other,I am tall as Oak
322,107192847.8,Edgwired,with a bullhorn bitches
322,107192871.6,Edgwired,thing is though tedi
322,107192877.3,Other,The truth is that she and i were friends before it all
322,107192883.1,Edgwired,if you really are going to be apart
322,107192885,Edgwired,...
322,107192887.7,Edgwired,fill in the blank
322,107192892.9,Edgwired,i told her
322,107192897.1,Edgwired,there's no fence to straddle here
322,107192901.1,Other,agreed
322,107192905.7,Other,that was my main point at well
322,107192912.7,Other,"? So i should just split?"
322,107192925.7,Other,that is yalls advice?
322,107192925.8,Other,a break means nothing if there is a net
322,107192930.5,Edgwired,right
322,107192932.3,Other,that's all i'm sayin
322,107192937.5,Edgwired,you two have been codependent
322,107192939.1,Edgwired,and
322,107192939.8,Edgwired,now
322,107192942.6,Edgwired,if you're going to not be
322,107192943.6,Edgwired,then
322,107192945.1,Other,its all mangled
322,107192951.8,Other,Yes this is true
322,107192954,Other,"if break, break"
322,107192956.7,Other,"if not, resolve"
322,107192959.1,Edgwired,right
322,107192964.1,Other,Hmmmmm
322,107192965.3,Other,none of this.. see you in a week shit
322,107192966.3,Edgwired,either way is fine
322,107192971.8,Edgwired,ha
322,107192981.5,Other,of course i'm all about black and white
322,107192981.7,Other,"Well, emotionally, neither is"
322,107192987.7,Other,right
322,107192998.1,Other,And our whole relationship is very very gray
322,107193007.9,Other,right
322,107193017.5,Edgwired,complex
322,107193017.9,Other,so either you two decide that you are going to work together to fix that
322,107193021.2,Other,and resolve all this shit
322,107193023.9,Other,or.....
322,107193033.3,Other,you decide that the solution is to take a real break
322,107193033.7,Other,Split
322,107193039.8,Other,yep
322,107193044.1,Other,Hmmmmm
322,107193048.3,Other,that way you each can free your minds for a bit
322,107193057.7,Other,"yeah, its a bit stressful now"
322,107193060.8,Other,instead of muddling around in the swamp of ambituity
322,107193063.4,Other,Cause that is a lot
322,107193066.3,Other,yeah
322,107193068.1,Other,i hear that
322,107193072,Other,well the ambiguity
322,107193079.9,Other,worked when they needed to work
322,107193086.5,Other,its a temp fix
322,107193087.9,Other,but i never brought up shit to the page
322,107193094.9,Other,that only delays
322,107193099.7,Other,"You see, i dont really feel like shit is broke"
322,107193108,Other,"and actually, we were getting along quite well"
322,107193125.7,Edgwired,TRUE
322,107193128.9,Edgwired,much better than the winter
322,107193129.5,Other,but now i see that that might have been steming from some guilt
322,107193135.8,Other,from Craven
322,107193139.6,Edgwired,HA
322,107193142.1,Edgwired,um
322,107193146.3,Edgwired,he's a pretty recent development
322,107193154.2,Edgwired,i think it was better before then
322,107193160.2,Other,yes
322,107193160.7,Edgwired,not to say it isn't contributing factor
322,107193173.2,Other,Well you see
322,107193175.3,Other,this whole thing
322,107193190,Other,is really making me step back and value a lot of things that i took for granted
322,107193225.3,Other,And it really makes me sad
322,107193227.2,Edgwired,mayhaps the purpose of such an experience
322,107193229.1,Other,because things were going
322,107193236.5,Other,so well for a while here
322,107193240.6,Other,"yeah, i said that"
322,107193242.3,Other,to her

322,107193283.4,Edgwired,HEH
322,107193286,Other,if this happened in January
322,107193289.3,Other,i would have said fuck it
322,107193290.4,Other,"then you get into the... well, do i want it so badly now that i've seen that i could lose it and it is now a challenge again"
322,107193303.5,Other,yeah
322,107193307,Edgwired,keeps it fresh
322,107193308.8,Other,"man, i need a fucking drink"

322,107193338.6,Other,LOl
322,107193347.9,Other,"Yeah, that's what it really all boils down to"
322,107193370,Other,This being something of a becon to see what ive not seen a minute
322,107193378.8,Other,and all that i have taken for granted
322,107193395.6,Edgwired,"yo, tedi, her affection is because she sees the same things"
322,107193395.6,Other,DAMN THESE CROSSROADS

322,107193414.9,Other,Same things?
322,107193430,Edgwired,she says to me all the time why she loves you
322,107193440.2,Edgwired,it's a spontaneous observation
322,107193445.6,Other,HA
322,107193449.8,Other,thats sweet
322,107193458.1,Edgwired,things she doesn't express when you're around so much
322,107193480.6,Edgwired,mostly because she focused on being the witness
322,107193486.7,Edgwired,and the adjuticator at once
322,107193496,Other," i know i love tedi, i know he loves me, we know we want to be together eventually"
322,107193502.5,Other,I can see it already
322,107193519.4,Other,"But people change in ways, mikey"
322,107193525.9,Other,and the big LET GO
322,107193527.8,Edgwired,always in flux
322,107193535.3,Edgwired,and you have to let go
322,107193539.4,Other,can cause for greater change
322,107193539.6,Edgwired,no matter when you choose to do it
322,107193561.7,Edgwired,cosmic inevitibility
322,107193570.7,Other,"I know i know all that shit, nostro"
322,107193575.7,Edgwired,so

322,107193613,Edgwired,so go process it
322,107193618,Other,"Honestly, all this discussion is pushing me closer to being back together"
322,107193621.4,Edgwired,ha
322,107193622.8,Other,than letting go
322,107193627.6,Edgwired,fine
322,107193629.2,Other,figure out why you feel that way
322,107193636.7,Other,"Well, I think i know"
322,107193639.9,Edgwired,there's a queue forming
322,107193660.5,Other,"Honestly, when one takes things for granted that are really important in one's life"
322,107193667.5,Other,and focuses on what they THINK is really important
322,107193710.8,Other,then one needs a jolt to remember the value of their original desire
322,107193728.2,Edgwired,"desire isn't enough tedi, you also need to be able to learn something new"
322,107193765,Other,How so?
322,107193782,Other,I am going to marinate on all of this
322,107193785.3,Edgwired,k

345,107967307.4,Edgwired,yeah
345,107967777.6,Other,alligator is quite expensive
345,107967824,Edgwired,you could try skinning one on your own..
345,107967924.4,Other,http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/addtionalImage.asp?pageID=2120
345,107967977.5,Other,http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/addtionalImage.asp?pageID=2122
345,107968054.7,Edgwired,eh
345,107968066.9,Edgwired,not my type.. but the first one works ok
345,107968083.9,Edgwired,actually
345,107968085.4,Edgwired,strike that
345,107968809.7,Other,http://www.whatshebuys.com/lod-111nx.html
345,107968870.6,Edgwired,what color is it?
345,107968876.3,Other,red or black
345,107968920,Other,i give up
345,107968924.4,Edgwired,ha
345,107968942.4,Edgwired,oh for fuck's sake
345,107969034,Edgwired,George Tenet resigned
345,107969958,Other,that's good
345,107970039.6,Edgwired,i want a hamburger
345,107970051.1,Other,me too
345,107974350.5,Edgwired,i think this flash presentation would work better as a straight video from screen
345,107974372.6,Other,what do you mean
345,107974402.1,Edgwired,most of the animation is just doing what you would do in the program anyway
345,107974412.1,Edgwired,at least
345,107974414.1,Edgwired,it could be
345,107974426.5,Edgwired,and the rest could be done in video
345,107974432.1,Edgwired,and
345,107974450,Edgwired,the version of the program that we're selling right now has some pretty serious graphics issues
345,107974460.8,Edgwired,that apparently didn't make the final cut
345,107974501.4,Other,ok
345,107974561.2,Other,you mean that there is part that could be done in video and the rest in flash?
345,107974568.5,Edgwired,eh
345,107974571.3,Edgwired,not really
345,107974573.3,Other,and put the video in the greater flash presentation
345,107974578.8,Edgwired,i'm saying
345,107974580.8,Edgwired,the whole thing
345,107974582.1,Edgwired,as video
345,107974593.9,Other,what was the original reason for flash
345,107974599,Edgwired,sameer
345,107974603.4,Edgwired,?
345,107974604,Other,not person
345,107974605.3,Other,reason
345,107974612.6,Edgwired,i don't see a difference
345,107974616.9,Edgwired,he said
345,107974619,Edgwired,he wanted
345,107974620.9,Edgwired,something like
345,107974622.1,Edgwired,something
345,107974625.5,Edgwired,that they showed me
345,107974627.5,Edgwired,which was flash
345,107974647.3,Edgwired,actually
345,107974652.4,Edgwired,i don't remember
345,107974654.9,Edgwired,before that
345,107974659.1,Edgwired,when we started talking about
345,107974659.9,Edgwired,it
345,107974663.2,Edgwired,so
345,107974664.9,Edgwired,i don't know
345,107974665.9,Edgwired,but
345,107974675.2,Edgwired,stepping through the email thing
345,107974678,Edgwired,and changing the levels
345,107974683.7,Edgwired,and switching between programs
345,107974688.1,Edgwired,and using the help
345,107974694.1,Edgwired,are all things that would look better in video
345,107974696.2,Edgwired,than in flash
345,107974702.9,Edgwired,pointing out the different elements
345,107974708.5,Edgwired,would work in either
345,107974731.1,Other,are you really considering changing it now?
345,107974733.9,Edgwired,distribution wise
345,107974737.5,Edgwired,flash is probably easier
345,107974739.1,Edgwired,although
345,107974744.7,Other,i'd say complete what you have to for tomorrow
345,107974745,Edgwired,most ppl don't have flash 6 or 7
345,107974754.9,Edgwired,what happens tomorrow?
345,107974758.1,Other,and then worry about the rest later
345,107974770.6,Other,the presentation is due?
345,107974778.4,Edgwired,ha
345,107974780.9,Edgwired,that's pretty funny
345,107974788.6,Other,was that not what you were told?
345,107974801.5,Edgwired,no idea
345,107974802.4,Other,when do you think it is supposed to be done?
345,107974802.4,Edgwired,really
345,107974818.6,Edgwired,last i remember
345,107974830.4,Edgwired,jason told me on monday of last week that he wanted it on wednesday of that week
345,107974838.7,Edgwired,so
345,107974839.6,Other,ok
345,107974845.4,Edgwired,that translates to me as
345,107974850.1,Edgwired,whenever it really gets done
345,107974856.5,Other,that fucking sucks
345,107974896.9,Other,i don't get how that means whenever
345,107974901.6,Other,seems to me that would mean asap
345,107974919.8,Edgwired,right
345,107974924.2,Edgwired,what's the difference
345,107974936.1,Other,whenever is leisurely
345,107974940.7,Other,asap is not
345,107974960.8,Other,deadline of wednesday last week would imply that it is already overdue by a week
345,107975185,Edgwired,my grandmother just fell over in the yard
345,107975194.8,Other,go help her
345,107975198.6,Edgwired,i did
345,107975206.9,Other,is she ok?
345,107975211.6,Edgwired,yeah
345,107975226.6,Other,lol
345,107975228.7,Other,go help her
345,107975234.5,Edgwired,i DID
345,107975237.2,Other,as if you needed me to tell you
345,107975292.5,Other,i was just laughing at myself
345,107975294.1,Other,anyway....
345,107975308.6,Other,i really don't understand why it is so difficult for you and jason to work with deadlines
345,107975329.8,Other,it's pretty pathetic really
345,107975338.9,Edgwired,jason's recent deadlines weren't set in rational states of mind
345,107975348.7,Other,right
345,107975351.2,Other,two to tango
345,107975362.9,Other,its up to you to tell him that and set one with him taht is reasonable
345,107975367.8,Edgwired,i did
345,107975370.3,Edgwired,i called him
345,107975376.2,Edgwired,immediately after i got the email
345,107975376.9,Other,when did you tell him it would be done then
345,107975379.2,Edgwired,and talked to him about it
345,107975384.3,Other,and?
345,107975387.4,Edgwired,i don't remember
345,107975391.9,Other,exactly
345,107975394.2,Edgwired,i'm not sure anything specific
345,107975397.8,Edgwired,was set
345,107975401.6,Other,weak
345,107975405.3,Edgwired,not weak
345,107975409.7,Other,quite weak
345,107975410.8,Edgwired,followed on simple.com
345,107975419.6,Edgwired,which got done yesterday
345,107975440.2,Other,there is no reason not to set deadlines for this shit
345,107975442.7,Other,lol
345,107975445.3,Other,double negative
345,107975455.4,Other,anyway...
345,107975472.8,Edgwired,it didn't seem imperative
345,107975474.2,Other,expect more weak ass arguments as a result
345,107975475.8,Edgwired,when we discussed it
345,107975483,Other,regardless
345,107975487.7,Other,everything should be clear
345,107975531.4,Other,otherwise it seems that all parties involved enjoy the craptacular situation that they perpetuate
345,107975553.7,Edgwired,eh
345,107975555.2,Edgwired,i'm over it
345,107975556.2,Edgwired,really
345,107975574.6,Other,then jason finds out that it's not going to be done tomorrow when he wants it
345,107975579.8,Other,and he yells
345,107975584.6,Other,and you wonder why
345,107975591.9,Edgwired,no
345,107975594.9,Edgwired,situation has changed
345,107975603.9,Other,alright
345,107975604.1,Edgwired,i don't wonder
345,107975615,Edgwired,it doesn't bother me enough to speculate
345,107975618.8,Other,"regardless, everyone suffers"
345,107975635,Edgwired,suffering is a state of mind induced only within the ego
345,107975642.9,Other,but... let's all act like sameer and i'm sure everything will work out
345,107975667.3,Edgwired,nobody yells like sameer
345,107975670.1,Edgwired,except sameer
345,107975677.2,Other,doesn't seem to be an real desire to make a success out of this on anyones part
345,107975702,Other,it's always someone else's fault
345,107975704.6,Other,or i don't care
345,107975707.7,Other,or i didn't think this
345,107975767.8,Other,will a video be larger or smaller file size than flash
345,107975774.2,Edgwired,hmmm
345,107975774.7,Other,more or less quality
345,107975776.5,Edgwired,larger
345,107975786.6,Edgwired,more quality
345,107975799.8,Other,in terms of still image quality
345,107975805.2,Other,or just that it flows better or whatever
345,107975825.9,Edgwired,"smaller image, better continuity"
345,107975844.6,Edgwired,less processor intentensive
345,107975862,Other,the overall screen size of the presentation?
345,107975866.2,Other,how will that be affected
345,107975876.4,Edgwired,by half
345,107975914.8,Other,half the size?
345,107975929.4,Edgwired,roughly
345,107975934.6,Edgwired,maybe 640X480
345,107975936.4,Other,that doesn't seem like a good idea
345,107975953.7,Edgwired,the screenshots themselves are 640X480 anyway
345,107975959.4,Edgwired,in the flash presentation
345,107975991,Other,"ok, size of simplec on the viewers screen"
345,107975996.2,Other,how is that affected
345,107975997.3,Other,none?
345,107976006,Edgwired,possibly
345,107976021.3,Edgwired,determining factor is end file size
345,107976034.7,Edgwired,eh
345,107976039,Other,i'd do it in flahs
345,107976040.8,Other,flash
345,107976044.5,Edgwired,video is too long to be small
345,107976048.1,Other,that is my suggestion
345,107976049.4,Edgwired,file size
345,107976052.5,Other,right
345,107976068.8,Other,flash player is available for free correct?
345,107976076.6,Edgwired,yup
345,107976082.8,Other,no problem there then
345,107976085.1,Edgwired,also
345,107976088.9,Edgwired,third possibility
345,107976093,Other,shoot it
345,107976095.8,Edgwired,video inside of flash
345,107976103.4,Edgwired,flash seven ships with its own codec
345,107976114.2,Other,do we have?
345,107976118.8,Edgwired,i have
345,107976121.9,Edgwired,not many other people have
345,107976127.7,Other,need flash 7 to play?
345,107976130,Edgwired,yes
345,107976135.8,Other,which is not free
345,107976137,Other,?
345,107976141.3,Edgwired,is free
345,107976157.3,Other,sorta sux that nearly anyone would have to download tho
345,107976183,Edgwired,yes
345,107976205.4,Other,i wouldn't want to give a flash presentation to someone I was trying to convince of simplec being easy... all with the requirement that they download the latest flash
345,107976230.6,Edgwired,that's logical
345,107976235.3,Other,it seems that a regular flash presentation is the best way to go
345,107976293.4,Edgwired,k
345,107976354.6,Other,i think these issues can be brought up and addressed before the next version of this presentation is assigned/developed
345,107976402.5,Other,for now just need *something* to facilitate the demonstration of simplec without having the person buy/download/actually use the program
346,108053213.7,Other,whattup
346,108053218.8,Edgwired,nm
346,108053221.6,Edgwired,"ytou?"

352,108424889.8,Other,i've heard mixed
352,108424900,Other,"about how pro has features, but is harder to use"

361,109609695.2,Edgwired,a lot of it might not be worth the trouble of doing
361,109609697,Edgwired,is all
361,109609706.5,Edgwired,i think you're splitting hairs
361,109609717.9,Edgwired,but

361,109610166.8,Edgwired,:)
361,109610218,Edgwired,"i don't usually get multiple ideas for things. i get one and the go with it until it doesn't work anymore, and then i might get another one"
361,109610228,Other,well
361,109610239.7,Other,i thought about it in terms of the text that I made
361,109610250.7,Other,and what i would say if someone told me to make 3 proposals of that
361,109610261,Other,"which, i would not be so willing to do"
361,109610266.3,Other,so i understand that
361,109610281.5,Other,"the difference, however, is that once i submit the first proposals"

361,109610366.8,Other,i'll give you feedback
361,109610444.2,Edgwired,"i think the multiple solutions thing is the best way for an analytical problem, but in something like EQ, the efficient way is to work with your best idea"
361,109610514.7,Edgwired,analytical solutions have comparable results whereas emotional ones are almost completely arbitrary
361,109610530.7,Edgwired,and measure only by the end effect
361,109610765.5,Other,don't be so emotional
361,109610778.2,Edgwired,i'm dropping my hotmail account
361,109610787.3,Edgwired,you pay me to be emotional
361,109610796.7,Other,effective

362,109611629.4,Other,email button

362,109611639.9,Other,i dunno
362,109611649.6,Edgwired,i like the trays better than the buttons
362,109611653.7,Other,what do you feel evokes the proper buying emotion

362,109611731.3,Other,show me
362,109611761,Other,white makes sense to me
362,109611763.1,Other,it's SIMPLE
362,109611782.7,Other,"although,, them ther idiots be lovin them some colour"
362,109611800.9,Edgwired,other possiblity is to take the web application

362,109611813.4,Other,inside of what
362,109611824.4,Edgwired,put the text inside of the web window

362,109611964,Edgwired,you all don't consider my tendency towards the minimal to be sexy enough
362,109612046.7,Other,TRUE
362,109612102.7,Edgwired,"although if you really thought about it, you go more for the minimal than anything else, i.e. a 12 inch powerbook"

362,109612165.4,Other,i'm not designing or writing or anything for myself or my tastes
362,109612167.7,Edgwired,and not limited to intelligent people
362,109612182.4,Other,"sure, but they need a reason to buy"
362,109612234.6,Edgwired,as far as the art is concerned that reason only extends as far as having a design that's cohesive.. the reason you're looking for comes in the text
362,109612248.2,Other,right
362,109612253.2,Other,i just want art to match the text
362,109612256.9,Other,to look good

378,110129389.3,Other,yeah....... could just loop a shorter section
378,110129407.7,Other,if you had each section timed... just loop one part of a song
378,110129419.1,Edgwired,"i tried putting in a track i had, and it didn't exactly work"

379,110133464.3,Edgwired,?
379,110133764.6,Other,she is really trying to pass this off like it makes sense
379,110133769.7,Other,i don't understand
379,110133795.3,Other,she just called and told me she felt like she was getting used
379,110133797.5,Edgwired,don't argue with her... let her act it out and eventually she'll realize she's being irrational
379,110133806.2,Other,"because it's my family, my friends"

379,110133886,Edgwired,"um, i don't necessarily agree with her"
379,110133931.2,Edgwired,but i don't think it's something you can talk your way out of

379,110137178.8,Edgwired,"for a person who works in black and white, that statement was awfully gray"
379,110137289.8,Other,at any rate
379,110137305.5,Other,my patience for the situation is wearing quite thin
379,110137325.7,Other,its the complete lack of maturity and mature communication
379,110137330.8,Other,that really pisses me off
379,110137343.5,Other,just a spoiled little brat that throws a tantrum if she doesn't get her way
379,110137356.8,Edgwired,don't make a decision while you're angry.
379,110137389.2,Edgwired,you might already have all of the information
379,110137410.2,Edgwired,but you're going to feel more comfortable with it if you can make it under normal circumstances
379,110137481.7,Other,clearly
379,110137486.8,Other,i'm chillin for now
379,110137505.2,Other,but the number of times i can regroup from this is decreasing
379,110137521.5,Other,i'm starting to think i just need to be in a different situation
379,110137536,Edgwired,that's perfectly rational
379,110137543.7,Other,so anyway

379,110137641.6,Edgwired,"30"" - 3300"
379,110137654.6,Edgwired,plus a $600 graphics card
379,110137656.8,Edgwired,to drive it
379,110137661.6,Edgwired,because no other graphics card
379,110137663.1,Edgwired,can
379,110137671,Other,that's completely stupid
379,110137679.1,Other,"so for a 20"
379,110137683.3,Other,you have to spend 1900?
379,110137688.7,Edgwired,no
379,110137694.3,Edgwired,the card is just for the 30 inch

380,110208446.4,Other,why can't we
380,110208458.1,Edgwired,for a different product maybe
380,110208466.8,Other,for ourselves
380,110208472,Edgwired,is this what you were looking for?

380,110208544.1,Other,http://store.airbomb.com/mmASCTEST/Images/large/q/CR5158.jpg
380,110208560.2,Edgwired,what is it
380,110208561.6,Other,keep in mind that part is 175 mm long
380,110208571,Other,made of aluminum
380,110208576,Edgwired,how long is 175 mm?
380,110208583.2,Other,less than a foot
380,110208597.1,Other,~8-9 inches
380,110208612.5,Edgwired,and why do you want them?
380,110208623.4,Other,just one
380,110208627.6,Other,because the one i have
380,110208634.3,Other,is stripped out on the inside
380,110208639.8,Edgwired,what is it?
380,110208644.7,Other,crank arm
380,110208651.6,Other,the pedal attaches to one end
380,110208655,Edgwired,ok
380,110208661.7,Other,"the other end to the font gears,,"
380,110208663.4,Edgwired,and you already have these
380,110208663.8,Other,basically
380,110208670.3,Other,"yes, i ahve the complete set"
380,110208673.8,Edgwired,ok
380,110208680.8,Edgwired,can you get just one?
380,110208705.2,Other,yep
380,110208708.9,Other,$50 
380,110208713.2,Other,for that one piece
380,110208719.3,Other,the other side looks like this
380,110208726,Other,http://store.airbomb.com/mmASCTEST/Images/large/q/CR8440.jpg
380,110208763.9,Edgwired,oh shit
380,110208769.4,Edgwired,it comes with the gear attached?
380,110208774.1,Other,one side
380,110208794.8,Edgwired,i guess that side is more expensive
380,110208800,Other,http://bike.shimano.com/product_images/FC/ev_images/EV-FC-M760-2261.pdf
380,110208802.7,Other,yes it is
380,110208808.2,Other,that is a complete set
380,110208845,Edgwired,hahaha
380,110208846.7,Other,but that is the new complete set i will buy after getting this part
380,110208862.8,Edgwired,wait
380,110208863.9,Edgwired,what?
380,110208871.7,Other,the advantage being that the one i just showed you has an axle all the way through
380,110208888.3,Edgwired,you're going to buy a new part
380,110208889.4,Edgwired,sell it
380,110208893.1,Edgwired,and buy the whole thing?
380,110208905.1,Other,right
380,110208910.8,Other,http://bike.shimano.com/product_images/FC/ev_images/FC_M571_EV.pdf
380,110208941.9,Other,see how this last one does not have the piece of metal going towards teh other side?
380,110208970.7,Other,specifically... there is no perpendicular tube attached to part #8 on the last one
380,110208991,Edgwired,ok
380,110208994.7,Other,"vs, the first schematic which has #8 with a tube"
380,110209004.8,Edgwired,the tube makes it what
380,110209009.5,Other,stronger
380,110209011.1,Other,lighter
380,110209014.3,Other,more durable
380,110209016.5,Other,less parts
380,110209018,Other,etc
380,110209028.9,Other,because in the case of the second version
380,110209050,Other,there is an entire part they build with bearings and shit packed into it that goes between #8 and #9
380,110209059.6,Edgwired,ah
380,110209068.3,Edgwired,the difference is noticable?
380,110209081.2,Other,yeah
380,110209083.6,Other,superior design
380,110209098.7,Other,and i imagine that it will last longer
380,110209104.3,Other,and require less maintenance
380,110209113.5,Other,and eliminate the problem i have with the current model
380,110209121,Edgwired,which is the stripping?
380,110209128.8,Other,right
380,110209136.8,Edgwired,stripped because of lack of post
380,110209149.5,Other,which was caused by part #9 coming loose from the part which the post replaces

394,110394795.4,Edgwired,just to clear this awful way of communicating up

394,110395681.1,Other,yeah.. i think bw is fine
394,110396477.2,Other,is it possible to have a css that treats different links differently

394,110396500.3,Edgwired,sure
394,110396519.8,Edgwired,i think you just use a different definition for the links
394,110397431.4,Edgwired,maybe you can use no definition for a: and then apply whatever you want to the actual links
394,110397465.2,Other,"yea,, i have to learn css better"
394,110397475.2,Other,it'll be less work in the end

394,110398249.1,Other,lol
394,110398254.5,Other,its a fucking presentation
394,110398260.7,Other,talk about dwelling
394,110398264.4,Edgwired,you wanted communication
394,110398267.3,Other,no
394,110398269.2,Other,i'm saying
394,110398269.3,Edgwired,that's communicating
394,110398271,Other,from jason

394,110398292.4,Other,yeah
394,110398294.8,Other,all full of shit
394,110398301.6,Edgwired,some of it is reasonable
394,110398304.5,Edgwired,some of it
394,110398305.9,Edgwired,is like
394,110398314.8,Edgwired,he's not even thinking about what he's saying
394,110398324.4,Other,he's most likely seeing red at this point
394,110398326.1,Edgwired,and saying it in such a way that i'm five year sold
394,110398332.9,Other,and tahts' why
394,110398341.5,Other,i know one thing
394,110398346.6,Edgwired,?
394,110398348.2,Other,all three of us have seen it too much
394,110398354.8,Other,and are therefore ocmpletely biased
394,110398357.3,Other,if you show it to gonzo
394,110398364.5,Other,he'd think it was absolutely fine
394,110398382,Other,and while I think there is the point that if we are in the business of simplification
394,110398392.8,Edgwired,"yes, he just said that offhand a few mintes ago"
394,110398394.5,Other,"and we can't convey a presentation in a simple cohesive manner,"
394,110398414.2,Other,then it reflects poorly on our company
394,110398415.2,Other,however
394,110398426.3,Other,i do not think that the presentation is THAT bad at this point
394,110398439,Other,and usually i will nit-pick until there aren't any nits left
394,110398466.3,Edgwired,i thought the version that i sent you was presentable
394,110398466.5,Other,the presentation is quite effective and clear in its current state
394,110398475.2,Edgwired,a lot of what he's asking for
394,110398476.2,Edgwired,is
394,110398477.1,Edgwired,just
394,110398480.1,Edgwired,overkill
394,110398484.8,Edgwired,i don't know
394,110398497.2,Edgwired,it doesn't bother me so much to put in if he really wants it
394,110398506.1,Other,the way this should work
394,110398512.3,Other,is we all should view it together
394,110398516.3,Other,comment as we go through
394,110398522.6,Other,stopping it and playing it
394,110398534.7,Edgwired,that what you and i did with that word file
394,110398544.4,Edgwired,but look
394,110398549.9,Edgwired,"Learning box - Do not show the help menu, only once it start pointing to the calendar, only the learning box should not be darkened - only the learning box should not be darkened; upon the presentation saying that ""SimpleC prompts you along the way"" the learning box should be enlarged with a focus upon the phrase ""Click Next"" this focus may be achieved by darkening everything except the click next phrase and the Next button."
394,110398551.8,Other,"outside of that, jason takes his side and feels like he has to get his way"
394,110398553.7,Edgwired,that right there
394,110398560.5,Edgwired,is impossible to do
394,110398563.9,Edgwired,literally
394,110398567.7,Edgwired,the box falls off the screen
394,110398573,Edgwired,and the next button isn't all there
394,110398577,Edgwired,and he didn't even look at it
394,110398583.3,Edgwired,and he's insisted on it three times
394,110398609,Edgwired,i don't think i'm being unreasonable
394,110398617.5,Edgwired,when i point stuff like that out
394,110398641.3,Edgwired,some of the other stuff is negotiable
394,110398646.1,Edgwired,like the step by step
394,110398659.4,Edgwired,and i really don't think putting a mask over everything all the time is going to help overall
394,110398665.9,Edgwired,but even that is something we can discuss
394,110398666.7,Edgwired,but
394,110398669.8,Edgwired,the demanding
394,110398676.7,Edgwired,and getting angry over it
394,110398684.2,Edgwired,is getting to be unreasonable for me
394,110398700.2,Edgwired,it doesn't improve my day to have these kinds of discussions
394,110398706.7,Edgwired,and it might not even be worth the experience
394,110398711.7,Other,it needs to be more of a discussion
394,110398713.6,Edgwired,of getting to learn more about this
394,110398721,Other,that's it
394,110398723.5,Edgwired,if we keep having to hate on each other
394,110398734,Other,i dunno
394,110398744.5,Other,i think he's probably frustrated/tired from his trip
394,110398749.8,Other,no excuse
394,110398752,Edgwired,nope
394,110398753.4,Edgwired,sorry
394,110398757.7,Other,anyway
394,110398761.7,Edgwired,it's more than just this trip
394,110398767.2,Other,i know
394,110398767.4,Edgwired,it's classic bad management
394,110398778.3,Edgwired,and i'm not blameless
394,110398779.9,Edgwired,at ALL
394,110398780.8,Edgwired,but
394,110398785.7,Edgwired,i know when i'm being abuse
394,110398786.9,Edgwired,d
394,110398844.8,Other,"when you don't do what is requested, supply a reason/logic"
394,110398859.2,Other,because it does come off as if you are simply disregarding/ignoring
394,110398887.4,Other,"on the other side of that coin... the recipient should ask ""why did you not do...."
394,110398915.1,Edgwired,"yeah, i mean, should i really write up a justification for every piece that i submit?"
394,110398922.2,Edgwired,that seems excessive
394,110398931.4,Other,if you are specifically not completing a requested item
394,110398944,Other,and not necessarily write up
394,110398946.6,Other,but somehow
394,110398949.3,Other,explain why
394,110398958.7,Edgwired,it just took me two hours to write that email
394,110398960.9,Edgwired,for four points
394,110398965.8,Other,right
394,110398969.7,Other,it woudl have taken 10 minuts
394,110398971.6,Other,to talk about
394,110398984.2,Other,maybe 25
394,110398988,Other,with the presentation in hand
394,110399015.9,Other,i'm calling jason....
394,110399021.8,Other,i don't even know where he is
394,110399022.9,Other,brb
394,110399026.2,Edgwired,k
394,110399200.5,Other,when can you come to philly next?
394,110399207.1,Edgwired,i'm in philly right now
394,110399210.6,Other,ahhh
394,110399213.9,Other,good times
394,110399217.3,Other,he's still in dc
394,110399231.5,Other,supposed to call me back shortly
394,110399245.5,Edgwired,i'm moving back into this city in a month
394,110399256.5,Other,"and, as i guessed.... has been dealing with complete incompetence"
394,110399268.9,Edgwired,listen
394,110399275.2,Edgwired,i am anything but incompetent
394,110399280.3,Other,i know that
394,110399297.6,Other,but it's hard to transition between the two....... at least for him apparently
394,110399309.3,Other,cause he does have to list things out step by step for others
394,110399313.8,Other,holding their hands
394,110399324,Other,and then he tries to do that with you.. which does not apply
394,110399338.4,Edgwired,micromanaging is not going to work in his facor
394,110399340,Edgwired,favor
394,110399344.6,Edgwired,in any event
394,110399347.1,Other,sure
394,110399349.3,Other,but he has to do that
394,110399351.7,Other,with others
394,110399354,Other,its pathetic
394,110399362.9,Edgwired,that's an HR issue
394,110399366.3,Other,yeah
394,110399376.7,Edgwired,but really
394,110399386.2,Other,there's too much to do for too few people
394,110399386.4,Edgwired,i don't think it's as much of an HR issue as it is a psychological issue
394,110399400.7,Other,because the people who are doing TEA stuff
394,110399402.4,Other,are idiots
394,110399405.1,Edgwired,Ha
394,110399414.2,Other,and he's having to micro manage that shit
394,110399427.9,Edgwired,Dan. You know i will not be micromanaged
394,110399434.5,Other,i know this
394,110399436.4,Edgwired,ok
394,110399438.3,Other,i think that's a big part of it
394,110399443.2,Other,that he tries to
394,110399448.6,Other,cause he has to with them so much
394,110399453,Other,he just keeps on steamrollin
394,110399457,Other,and doesn't realize
394,110399459.4,Other,that he shouldn't
394,110399465.6,Other,and that it works against him
394,110399470,Other,wasting time/effort
394,110399491.4,Edgwired,this is really it though
394,110399493.5,Edgwired,it has to change
394,110399503.6,Edgwired,or business changes
394,110399505.8,Edgwired,between us
394,110399509.7,Other,right
394,110399510.6,Edgwired,and really it's just business
394,110399544.3,Other,if someone were hired on a contract basis.... it might work better
394,110399548.1,Other,just giving them tasks
394,110399559.3,Other,if they were not responsible for original ideas
394,110399564.6,Edgwired,i think that's an amazingly bad idea
394,110399572.1,Edgwired,given the way we delegate work
394,110399578,Edgwired,and the way work gets processed
394,110399582.6,Edgwired,no one would ever get paid
394,110399586.9,Edgwired,for getting something done
394,110399594.2,Edgwired,because
394,110399599.4,Edgwired,"most things are never ""done"
394,110399602.2,Edgwired,around here
394,110399620.4,Other,"right, either that, or we would pay 5 times for one thing"
394,110399625.1,Edgwired,right
394,110399629,Edgwired,and you would end up with
394,110399632.6,Edgwired,a very limited vision
394,110399662.9,Other,they don't realize this
394,110399663.9,Edgwired,believe me
394,110399673.1,Edgwired,jason does NOT want to make the decisions that i make for him
394,110399681.4,Edgwired,if he goes much farther upstream
394,110399687.1,Edgwired,he's going to end up with shit on his desk
394,110399689.7,Edgwired,of his own doing
394,110399740,Edgwired,"i think it's reasonable to say that i'm a better artist than he is, and he has said it himself many times."
394,110399750.6,Edgwired,so micromanaging my art with his vision
394,110399756,Edgwired,ends up with the shitty vision
394,110399763.2,Edgwired,that's logical
394,110399764.4,Edgwired,right?
394,110399784.6,Other,but if he see's soemthing as open for improvement
394,110399790.1,Edgwired,fine
394,110399797.6,Other,such as emphasizing the buttons or whatever
394,110399810,Edgwired,he's not open to alternatives
394,110399817,Edgwired,and when were into details like this
394,110399821.2,Edgwired,and i keep saying this
394,110399824.6,Edgwired,it's mostly arbitrary
394,110399826.4,Edgwired,and really
394,110399841.2,Edgwired,i'm supposed to be the one that makes the call
394,110399845.6,Edgwired,over what's arbitrary
394,110399861.4,Other,i know that for me it makes it much clearer if only the button in question is light up
394,110399861.7,Edgwired,because i'm supposebly the professional in this regard
394,110399874.7,Edgwired,and if you read my response
394,110399877.7,Edgwired,i say that's fine
394,110399880.8,Other,on that specific issue... but i also understand the difficulty
394,110399898.1,Edgwired,but the technical issues outweighted the strength of clarity
394,110399902.4,Other,right
394,110399927.5,Edgwired,"ok, but i'm still getting taken to the mat for making that call"
394,110399952.2,Other,because you didn't explain at all
394,110399959.1,Other,you are half right
394,110399967.2,Edgwired,i didn't have the opportunity to explain
394,110399970.3,Edgwired,there was no discussion
394,110399974.3,Edgwired,there were no questions
394,110399975.8,Other,there was a request
394,110399983.4,Edgwired,and a response
394,110399985.1,Other,there was a submission which did not fulfill
394,110400002.7,Other,without explanation as to why
394,110400015.7,Other,then a reactionary reponse to the lack of fullfillment
394,110400017.3,Edgwired,if it were a verbal conversation
394,110400023.6,Other,it would have been smooth
394,110400030.4,Edgwired,a question would have followed
394,110400034.3,Edgwired,if it were a verbal argument
394,110400038.3,Edgwired,a reaction would have followed
394,110400039,Edgwired,now
394,110400043.9,Edgwired,we're having an argument
394,110400047.2,Edgwired,instead of a conversation
394,110400049.2,Edgwired,and i'm not the one
394,110400051.8,Edgwired,that's caused it
394,110400124,Other,no
394,110400124.8,Other,he did
394,110400130.3,Other,the situation did
394,110400131.7,Other,whatever
394,110400136.8,Other,the solution is to tlak about it
394,110400141.7,Other,instead of shooting arrows
394,110400186.5,Edgwired,this is why i can't talk to sameer though
394,110400189.3,Edgwired,it's the same pattern
394,110400200,Edgwired,and if it's really going to be like that with jason
394,110400225.6,Edgwired,then i'm only realizing it right now
394,110400260.2,Edgwired,and it's not acceptable
394,110400279.9,Edgwired,with sameer its acceptable because i never have to work with sameer
394,110400281.6,Edgwired,with jason
394,110400298,Edgwired,i'm sorry but i hate being dragged down into this kind of drama
394,110400416.3,Other,basically jason should have discussed instead of throwing it back
394,110400423.9,Other,end of discussion
394,110400450.9,Edgwired,ok
394,110400454.2,Other,right?
394,110400455.2,Edgwired,i'm going to to take a walk
394,110400460.5,Edgwired,that's what i think
394,110400466.5,Other,do that
394,110400477.9,Edgwired,i'll be here until i get ahold of roxana
395,110400929,Other,call jason
396,110404488.8,Other,did you call jason
396,110404501,Edgwired,going to finish my snickers bar first
396,110404503.9,Other,lol
396,110404505.2,Other,do that
396,110404509.8,Other,you'll need the engergy
396,110404515.5,Other,i'm going to play squash with gzo
396,110404519.4,Edgwired,k
396,110404522.4,Other,take it out on the squash ball
396,110404535.1,Other,might be a sinking ship everyone should jump off of
396,110404538.3,Other,anyway.. i'm seeing red
396,110404540.1,Other,talk to you later
396,110404543,Edgwired,i'm not going to argue with him
396,110404552.2,Edgwired,if he gets foolish with me
396,110404554.3,Edgwired,i'm going to hang up
396,110404556.3,Edgwired,and that will be it
396,110404568.9,Other,i think you would have been better to tell him why you didn't do what we requested when you submitted it
396,110404574.5,Other,that's the only thing i can say
396,110404589.8,Edgwired,ok
396,110404599.6,Other,i don't necessarily agree with either of you
396,110404603,Other,its a process problem

408,112757805.6,Edgwired,tell her to keep it to herself
408,112757809.4,Edgwired,ha
408,112757811.3,Edgwired,so
408,112757819.8,Edgwired,have you started messing with ColdFusion yet
408,112757820.6,Edgwired,?
408,112757895.6,Other,not yet
408,112757899.4,Other,that's my next project
408,112757912.3,Other,i'm focusing on finishing this web project
408,112757922.6,Other,after that i am going to experiment with colfusion
408,112757937.8,Other,but gonzo and I are reading about setting up a business right now
408,112757953.5,Other,and have been discussing what to do in the future
408,112757977,Edgwired,i finally talked to the guy from the gallery tonight
408,112757985.5,Edgwired,going to start planning a project for them
408,112757995.5,Edgwired,that's basically a web application
408,112758003.4,Edgwired,starting to think about what would be best to use
408,112758033.4,Edgwired,coldfusion isn't a database itself is it?
408,112758041.9,Edgwired,it's just a method of accessing databases
408,112758102.5,Other,right
408,112758112.3,Other,basically you have flash.. which is the web side
408,112758136.6,Other,"then the database which, is, obviously the database side on the server, then you have coldfusion which connects the two"
408,112758149.2,Edgwired,ok
408,112758154.9,Other,this is exaclty the sort of stuff gonzo and i have been talking about
408,112758164.1,Edgwired,can you set up flash pro to store data itself?
408,112758164.4,Other,"by the way,,, ichat is the shit"
408,112758166.4,Edgwired,ha
408,112758168.3,Edgwired,this i know
408,112758179.3,Other,"no,, you have to use an intermediary language"
408,112758182,Edgwired,now we really need cameras
408,112758183.9,Other,such as coldfusion
408,112758188.4,Other,"yeah, seriously"
408,112758189.2,Edgwired,or webobjects
408,112758199.4,Edgwired,i've got one actually
408,112758202.7,Edgwired,and so does gonzo
408,112758212.9,Other,i have a camera at my apt too actually
408,112758221.8,Other,dunno how well it would work with the apple
408,112758223.6,Other,but anyway
408,112758233.2,Edgwired,if it's firewire it will work fine
408,112758238.4,Other,this is the exact situation gzo and I were talking about
408,112758242.3,Other,he knows the back end
408,112758261.7,Other,i know the front end and overall project management
408,112758266,Other,etc
408,112758288,Edgwired,"yeah, developing web services for small business is definitely an underserved market at this moment"
408,112758299.1,Edgwired,will last for maybe 5 more years
408,112758316.8,Edgwired,decent money
408,112758326.4,Edgwired,the strictly funny thing about all of this is
408,112758339.3,Edgwired,that I think I'm doing this on a project basis
408,112758347.5,Edgwired,managing it myself though
408,112758364.1,Edgwired,incorporate as a consultancy
408,112758373.7,Edgwired,pay no taxes
408,112758382.1,Edgwired,live in tahiti
408,112758397.9,Edgwired,once you develop one framework
408,112758402,Edgwired,you can carbon copy it
408,112758409.8,Edgwired,for a specific market
408,112758414,Edgwired,like real estate
408,112758427.4,Edgwired,revenue wise
408,112758454.3,Edgwired,trick is to do it cheaply i guess
408,112758461.9,Edgwired,because that's where the market will shake itself out
408,112758483.8,Edgwired,"eh, maybe not"
408,112758490.5,Edgwired,at least not right now
408,112758497.8,Edgwired,"if you do it well, i bet you can charge an ass load"
408,112758524.6,Edgwired,ok
408,112758531.5,Edgwired,going to go beat jak and daxter #2

409,114536450.2,Edgwired,these bills are a small catasrophe
409,114536459.9,Edgwired,i'm going to end up going back to the first of the year and redoing it all
409,114536466.7,Other,damn
409,114536468.1,Edgwired,they've been doing their purchase orders by hand
409,114536469.7,Other,good luck with that
409,114536471.1,Edgwired,meh

410,114541295.1,Edgwired,ha
410,114541300.6,Edgwired,what was the prob?
410,114541312.5,Other,the problem is that you can do this in any number of ways
410,114541316.2,Other,and i wanted to do it my way
410,114541340.2,Other,i have yet to completely grasp the best ways to work with flash
410,114541349.4,Other,"in terms of scenes, embedded movie clips, etc"
410,114541359.7,Other,but scenes was the final success route
410,114541368.1,Edgwired,ah
410,114541382,Edgwired,are you going to leave it the way it is?
410,114541400.1,Other,leave what the way it is?
410,114541407,Edgwired,the code
410,114541410.1,Other,eh
410,114541411.3,Other,maybe
410,114541416.3,Other,i might play around a little more
410,114541423.1,Edgwired,ha
410,114541426.8,Other,but i'm happy with the general state
410,114541602.2,Other,i didn't show you the mock up intros
410,114541640,Edgwired,?
410,114541640.7,Other,http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/IntroGrey.html
410,114541640.7,Other,http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/IntroBlack.html
410,114541683.4,Edgwired,i like the grey
410,114541689,Other,i knew it
410,114541693,Edgwired,don't like the rotate
410,114541696.5,Other,yeah
410,114541702.1,Other,i didn't know how to get it from the middle to the corner
410,114541713.1,Other,a slide looks worse IMO
410,114541721,Other,any ideas?
410,114541724.7,Edgwired,flowers grow
410,114541763.4,Other,skip the rotate and just grow the flower from the corner?
410,114541784.5,Edgwired,yeah
411,114544524,Other,http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/IntroductionBlack.html
411,114544673.7,Other,http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/IntroductionGrey.html
411,114545025.6,Edgwired,i like the way it grows from the right
411,114545051.4,Edgwired,the one in the center is odd
411,114545057.3,Edgwired,shifts to the right
411,114545133,Other,that's odd
411,114545137.9,Other,after it comes to the foreground?
411,114545143.1,Other,or during its transition
411,114545214.1,Other,"also, do you notice any ""boxes"" around the images?"
411,114545684.2,Edgwired,no boxes
411,114545693.9,Other,werd
411,114545704,Edgwired,when it comes to the foreground it pushes the kappa farther than the sigma
411,114545722,Other,that's what your eyes tell you
411,114545740.4,Other,nevermind
411,114545743.5,Other,you're right
411,114546572.2,Other,the kappa is just wider
412,114558970.1,Edgwired,"yay, our wireless reaches to the train station"
412,114559090.5,Edgwired,dude
412,114559096.2,Edgwired,i'm getting hit on my 50 year old women
412,114559102.5,Edgwired,decent looking
413,114628219.1,Other,how much money would someone have to pay you for you to let them puke in your mouth
413,114628232.7,Edgwired,"$15,000 "

413,114628275.5,Other,amongst the office
413,114628281.8,Other,"my threshold was 10,000"

413,114628301.4,Other,i was like... yes.... twice
413,114628303.5,Edgwired,"i figured in a $5,000 asshole tax"
413,114628355.2,Edgwired,"$5,000,000, no question"

413,114628646.7,Other,if you were in a pool up to your neck in puke and someone threw a bag of diarrhea at your face... would you duck?
413,114628681.6,Edgwired,"if you were in a pool of puke, you'd probably start to disintegrate"
413,114628689.5,Other,ok smartass

413,114628705.2,Edgwired,quick enough to get out
413,114628711.4,Other,lol
413,114628899.5,Other,see. the thing i don't get with flash is what the best methods are for changing pages for example
413,114628912.5,Other,cause you could make a page a movieclip... or a frame... or a scene
413,114628995.8,Edgwired,personal preference
413,114629006.9,Other,does it not affect the size of the swf?
413,114629015.8,Edgwired,i've read things that acknowledge that the difference is small
413,114629017.9,Edgwired,nah
413,114629020.6,Edgwired,same objects
413,114629021.4,Edgwired,diff
413,114629022.5,Edgwired,code

413,114629774.8,Other,i have it at 550 pixels now
413,114629790.5,Other,afraid that if i go to 725 or so... the swf will get to large
413,114629792.7,Edgwired,that's big enough
413,114629795.5,Other,suggestions?
413,114629796.7,Other,werd
413,114629806.7,Other,that's the default
413,114629829.1,Other,yeah
413,114629845.9,Other,even with my monitor on 1280X 1024
413,114629849.5,Other,i see things fine
413,114629874.3,Other,flash is supposed to display the same on all browsers... correct?
413,114629965.6,Edgwired,yes
413,114629975.1,Other,that's what still gets me..
413,114629983.8,Other,julian said that when he viewed the grey animation
413,114629998.6,Other,"that there were ""boxes"" around the graphics as they moved"
413,114630037.4,Edgwired,maybe the version of flash?
413,114630042.5,Other,maybe
413,114630046.7,Other,that's what i thought
413,114630094.8,Other,you saw the one with the menu rollovers.. right?
413,114630287.3,Edgwired,y
414,114704617.5,Other,how's your day goin?

414,114705689.8,Other,just would be better if it reversed out
414,114705698.4,Edgwired,the rollover is great
414,114705977.6,Other,"it was weird, i tried to assign onOver and onRollOut behaviors to each rollover movie clip,,, but it would get all screwed up... so i had to put a button over each movie clip"
414,114706004.6,Edgwired,that's what i did for neocyde.net
414,114706046.6,Other,and then just used instances of the same movie clip.. right?

415,114714595.1,Other,yes?
415,114714617.8,Edgwired,i just had this confrontation about vacation/sick days
415,114714627.4,Other,what about
415,114714639.6,Edgwired,"the fact that she was like, ""one week is standard"
415,114714648.9,Edgwired,and it took me a WEEK to get her to say it
415,114714660.8,Other,are you on salary?
415,114714663.3,Edgwired,yes
415,114714671.9,Other,that's nice
415,114714674.7,Other,benefits?
415,114714675.6,Edgwired,"and she said ""we don't take sick days"
415,114714688.4,Edgwired,benefits MAYBE after 6mo - 1 year
415,114714689.9,Other,"wait.. so if you get sick, it cuts into your vacation?"
415,114714697.5,Edgwired,i asked her that
415,114714705.1,Edgwired,the real problem is that you can't nail her down on anything
415,114714712.1,Other,whatever
415,114714714.3,Edgwired,and these are pretty simple questions
415,114714718.3,Edgwired,she said
415,114714724.1,Edgwired," people just make up the day"
415,114714729,Edgwired,because i said
415,114714741.7,Edgwired,i'm not taking a day of my week's vacation if i'm sick
415,114714743.3,Edgwired,and really
415,114714747.1,Edgwired,i'm insisting on two weeks
415,114714766.3,Edgwired,"because for 25K, i'm getting two fucking weeks of vacation, i don't care what fucking industry it is"
415,114714771.4,Edgwired,she said
415,114714776.9,Edgwired,after 3 months we'll talk about it
415,114714799.7,Edgwired,i think she feels like that even talking about it is annoying
415,114714801.7,Edgwired,or
415,114714806.2,Edgwired,presumptive
415,114714811.1,Edgwired,and i'm like
415,114714813.3,Edgwired,listen
415,114715056.7,Other,dude
415,114715063.2,Other,she just doesn't want to give away the bank
415,114715066.4,Other,on the first day
415,114715070.2,Other,work with her for a while
415,114715071.8,Other,ease into it
415,114715078.2,Other,if she's still stubborn about it in a month
415,114715083,Other,then you have a problem
415,114715087.4,Other,you have a legitimate point
415,114715089,Other,she knows that
415,114715095.5,Other,but doesn't know how to handle the situation
415,114715128.1,Other,she's intimidated by the fact that you have a legitimate point.. you know it... and you are smart enough to out-negotiate her on it
415,114715385.7,Edgwired,"i tried to tell her that me going to business school was going to work out for her in the long run, but she's definitely not used to dealing with it"
415,114715422.3,Other,you mean having gone to b-school?
415,114715542.1,Edgwired,right
415,114715547.1,Other,right
415,114715559.2,Other,"she's smart enough to agree tho,,, right?"
415,114715563.8,Edgwired,she really doesn't have any conception of how bad her books are
415,114715569.2,Edgwired,in her own way
415,114715577.7,Edgwired,she really work like i was trying to work with Jason
415,114715583.4,Edgwired,"like ""everything will work itself out"
415,114715588.5,Edgwired,"instead of ""lets do this methodically"
415,114715592.5,Other,eyah
415,114715597.3,Other,that doesn't work out so well
415,114715601.9,Edgwired,ha
415,114715607.2,Other,in certain areas
415,114715616.7,Edgwired,we worked it out
415,114715623.8,Edgwired,i told her it has to be this way for a while
415,114715629,Edgwired,because if i'm not superorganized
415,114715637.4,Edgwired,it's not going to ever become automated
415,114715642.3,Other,exactly
415,114715682.3,Other,"sounds like a situation where things need to be ""laid out"
415,114715702.4,Other,like... listen here lady... you may not know this... but i'm the best thing to come your way in a long time
415,114715711,Other,and you're trying to shaft me over like i'm a regular idiot
415,114715717.7,Other,"which, obviously , i am not"
415,114715739.4,Other,but i know that you don't want to give everything away... I just want a reasonable situation for both of us
415,114715743.3,Other,blah blah blah
415,114715796.6,Edgwired,EXACTLy
415,114715800.6,Edgwired,that's what i said
415,114715804.7,Edgwired,it has to be mutual
415,114715808.4,Edgwired,or i'm going to get frustrated
415,114715815.9,Edgwired,and we both don't want that
415,114715841.8,Other,right
415,114715854.3,Other,you'd leave
415,114715860.1,Other,"which, would set her back, yet again"
415,114715959.2,Other,kerning isn't showing up when i preview
415,114715978.6,Edgwired,no idea
415,114715981.5,Edgwired,could be a bug
415,114716132.4,Other,"if i were to make it reverse, do you think it should reverse while the new one comes out, or sequentially.. reverse, then come out"
415,114716237.9,Edgwired,um
415,114716242.4,Edgwired,quicker is better
415,114716245.5,Edgwired,in most cases
415,114716249.9,Other,yeah
415,114716250.4,Edgwired,for a menu
415,114716251.6,Other,same time
415,114716300.6,Other,i don't think the reversing out will work so well
415,114716316.1,Other,because what would i do with the sub menu while the new submenu comes out
415,114716363.6,Edgwired,that can just go away
415,114716379.4,Other,and have the menu items moving at the same time
415,114716385.5,Edgwired,y
416,114722829.4,Other,how far are you into actionscript in terms of controlling movieclips and such
416,114723231.2,Edgwired,not very
416,114723233.6,Edgwired,?
416,114723267.2,Other,playing
416,114723273,Other,trying to get this shit to work out like i want
416,114723278,Other,there are so many tutorials out there
416,114723283.4,Other,but they are limited in scope
416,114723289.4,Other,they tell you how to do one specific thing
416,114723299.7,Other,"and, of course, i always want to do it my way"
416,114723317.2,Edgwired,yeah
416,114723459.1,Other,slow goin
416,114723466.6,Other,but enough to feel like i'm getting somewhere

434,116441723.9,Other,no
434,116441727.3,Other,the idea
434,116441727.5,Edgwired,so that you could log into another computer

434,116441836.9,Other,user
434,116441838.7,Other,not server
434,116441874.1,Edgwired,i still wish i could see the cursor move
434,116441880.1,Edgwired,so you could show someone else how to fix it
434,116441883.1,Other,plug the monitor into your computer then
434,116441884.4,Edgwired,remotely
434,116441891.6,Other,oh

434,116441929.6,Other,due to fucking bullshit ass restrictions
434,116441938,Other,as if i'm going to break the machine or something
434,116441945.2,Other,"but yeah, i can spy on the guy i work with"
434,116441955.4,Other,although it is pretty apparent when you machine starts to lag

460,118589948.6,Edgwired,i can't get used to them
460,118589959.9,Other,and the option to click and drag a line to bend it
460,118589982,Other,i like the interface better than using the points in fireworks
460,118589990.6,Edgwired,"yeah, i see that"
460,118590012.7,Edgwired,"you can import stuff from illustrator, but i'm not sure it retains the vectors"

460,118590113.9,Edgwired,no idea how
460,118590118.6,Edgwired,so it doesn't submit forms

460,118590131.5,Other,that's weak
460,118590139.6,Edgwired,a bit
460,118590140.1,Other,i find that it just doesn't cover all my needs
460,118590151,Other,and i hate the fact that explorer is even on my machine
460,118590158,Edgwired,why not firefox?
460,118590159.5,Other,but it works when i need it to
460,118590161.5,Other,eh
460,118590164.1,Other,laziness
460,118590172.4,Other,so i guess the hate hasnt built up enough yet

461,118610258.6,Other,and the password is pulled from a text file
461,118610261.5,Edgwired,http://www.aairpass.com/christmasbook/
461,118610270.2,Other,so all they have to do is change one word in a text file
461,118610275.7,Edgwired,not useful
461,118610286.1,Edgwired,i'm headed over to sign some due diligence for jason zamer
461,118610291.9,Other,what?
461,118610304.9,Edgwired,apparently he needs my signature on something
461,118610308.4,Other,ha
461,118610311.7,Edgwired,so he can get his investment
461,118610319.8,Other,that's odd
461,118610333.7,Edgwired,i think it was just a missed form
461,118610344.9,Edgwired,he thought the first options would cover the second
461,118610353.2,Other,got it
461,118610356.8,Edgwired,ok

462,118625305.4,Edgwired,http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/04/MNGM393GPK1.DTL
462,118625499.3,Other,kewl
462,118625511.3,Other,we're definitely going to kill ourselves
462,118625522.1,Edgwired,more likely than not
462,118625540.4,Edgwired,"The energy from colliding positrons and antielectrons ""is 10 billion times ... that of high explosive,"
462,118625542.3,Edgwired,awesome
462,118625551.7,Other,yeah
462,118625561.1,Other,i'll take a rain check on that demo day

462,118625588.3,Other,with a dynamic text file that hold's the password.
462,118625591.8,Other,ha
462,118625599.9,Other,yeah... that'd be great... tidal waves
462,118625618.4,Edgwired,that's not exactly secure?
462,118625628.3,Other,of course not
462,118625639.9,Other,they aren't housing information on antimatter bombs
462,118625646,Other,they just want to look cool
462,118625661.8,Other,"if I hid the directory the text file is in, it would be ok"
462,118625673.8,Other,i'm not even blacking out the password
462,118625678.7,Edgwired,"Smith is looking to store positrons in a quasi-stable form called positronium. A positronium ""atom"" (as physicists dub it) consists of an electron and antielectron, orbiting each other. Normally these two particles would quickly collide and self-annihilate within a fraction of a second -- but by manipulating electrical and magnetic fields in their vicinity, Smith hopes to make positronium atoms last much longer."
462,118625689.1,Edgwired,that sounds like a disaster waiting to happen
462,118625703.2,Other,yeah
462,118625826.8,Edgwired,so you have to have a password to get into what section?
462,118625833.3,Other,lol
462,118625849.4,Other,"a section that says."" you've entered the password protected portion of this site"
462,118625852.9,Edgwired,http://www.dansdata.com/kitten.htm

462,118626039,Other,suzanne is going to love that webpage
462,118626061.7,Edgwired,"Clearly, and despite competing opinions, a kitten is substantially preferable to a puppy. It's also, incidentally, obvious that a new video card is 1.5 times as desirable as a baby."
462,118626064.3,Edgwired,shit
462,118626086.9,Edgwired,"Clearly, and despite competing opinions, a kitten is substantially preferable to a puppy. It's also, incidentally, obvious that a new video card is 1.5 times as desirable as a baby."

481,120000327.9,Other,"~$300 is the appropriate price for this ski (used, bindings mounted), but I get it, you need to make a profit on the ski's you bought off ebay. Makes much more sense now.

488,120095424.7,Other,"Dear Dan, For your reference, this ski is never sold below 350+ on ebay (and that's before, shipping). There is where I got the price from (and I was going to be flexible on that as well). Here I am sending you two (fresh) links, from eBay, for your reference (both before shipping): http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=7107661707&ssPageName=STRK:MEWA:IT http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=21246&item=7108212803&rd=1 I was just offering our used skis to see if, eventually, we can change my wife's and my own gear. I do not know where you get your allegations of a business from, and you threatening me is nothing I would take lightly. I am not forcing you to buy from me, so I do not understand what's wrong with you. Good luck finding your skis, and take life a little easier, and do not go around falsely accusing people. Cheers, Pablo" 
488,120095468.3,Edgwired,did you send him a link to his auction?

497,120680015.7,Other,if that's what you're going for
497,120680024,Edgwired,there will be all kinds of reactions
497,120680030,Edgwired,tedi's friends all laughed
497,120680033.4,Other,right
497,120680723.4,Edgwired,"it could be the worst idea in the history of bad ideas, but even that makes it worth doing"
497,120681966.8,Edgwired,is she really not coming?
497,120681972.8,Other,prob not
497,120681980.6,Edgwired,you too?
497,120681989.5,Other,who knows
497,120682000.6,Edgwired,does she want to talk about it?
497,120682009.2,Other,i'm gonna say no
497,120682013.5,Other,she's upset with me at the moment
497,120682035.5,Other,not related to halloween.. i've just been bugging her and she needs to get work done
497,120682064.5,Other,"regarding the costume, i think it would probably make her uncomfortable regardless of any talking about it"
497,120682119.7,Edgwired,i think it might help if she at least understood why i decided to do it
497,120682144.5,Other,i don't know if that's true
497,120682176.6,Other,"it's the fact that other people will see it and have their ""reactions"", and that it is inevitable that it trivializes the crime/victim"
497,120682203.6,Other,"you, as the wearer, cannot prevent that from happening"
497,120682205.7,Edgwired,i disagree. i think it's cause for discussion of something serious
497,120682212.8,Other,at a party?
497,120682220.9,Other,i don't think it's an appropriate forum
497,120682267.5,Edgwired,yeah it probably does trivialize it.
497,120682274.5,Edgwired,i guess i'm not bothered by that
497,120682357.3,Edgwired,the artistic statement behind it is powerful
497,120682402.7,Edgwired,rape is trivialized by the evening news
497,120682416.7,Edgwired,it's social commentary
497,120682548,Other,the evening news is not dressing up in a costume at a party
497,120682555.9,Other,they are reporting the events
497,120682568.7,Edgwired,nah
497,120682571.4,Edgwired,they're selling soap
497,120682584.2,Edgwired,put this in context
497,120682588.1,Edgwired,it's a halloween party
497,120682594.9,Edgwired,it's not a costume ball
497,120682604.3,Edgwired,at a costume ball it would be completely inappropriate
497,120682617.5,Edgwired,but the point of halloween is to celebrate everything that's wrong with culture
497,120682618.3,Other,put it in this context
497,120682622.5,Other,if a girl is at your party
497,120682626.8,Other,and there is someone dressed as rape
497,120682662.7,Other,"and people are laughing at it, regardless of whether or not their laughter is rooted in discomfort, ignorance, immaturity"
497,120682672.9,Other,it will inevitably make that girl uncomfortable
497,120682714,Other,it's your party
497,120682717.7,Other,you can do whatever you want
497,120682725.6,Other,i'm not saying anything against that
497,120682748,Other,just don't expect everyone to think it's appropriate
497,120682767.8,Other,and do expect people to be repulsed by it
497,120682781.9,Other,not like ewww... that's gross repulsed...
497,120682812.9,Other,"more like, what kind of mind thinks that is even close to OK, how is it possible that all these people are standing here thinking that it's OK"
497,120682860.6,Edgwired,the kind of person you're describing is both judgemental and insecure
497,120682881,Edgwired,and that's not the type of person i cater to
497,120682887.2,Other,ok
497,120682905.3,Other,"i don't think anyone should be ""secure"" with the topic of rape"
497,120682911.8,Edgwired,i do
497,120682917.2,Edgwired,certainly
497,120682918.9,Other,that's ridiculous
497,120682922.6,Edgwired,"no, it isn't"
497,120682941,Edgwired,fear of the issue is what causes it to happen
497,120682960.5,Other,respect for those who have endured it and have to deal with it on a daily basis
497,120682980.3,Other,if i had been raped
497,120682987.9,Other,and i saw someone dressed as rape
497,120682990.9,Other,at a party
497,120683018.2,Other,i really want you to explain to me how you are going to come up to me and tell me everything is ok
497,120683052.4,Edgwired,such a person has to face that fear and be able to deny it
497,120683058.1,Other,fear?
497,120683059.8,Edgwired,to ever be ok
497,120683072.3,Edgwired,yeah
497,120683077.8,Other,one should never be ok with rape
497,120683078.8,Edgwired,the fear of the act happening again
497,120683090.6,Other,there are other issues
497,120683094,Edgwired,i'm not trying to justify rape
497,120683102.9,Other,just mock it
497,120683103.8,Edgwired,that's deifnitely not the point
497,120683112.6,Other,and even if it isn't YOUR point to mock it
497,120683122.4,Edgwired,"yeah, put it in a box and make it abstract"
497,120683126.1,Other,the fact that there is an entire party of people around you accepting it does
497,120683153.5,Other,"and you're tellin me that as a hypothetical rape victim, i'm supposed to be ok with that"
497,120683176.8,Edgwired,"yes. i'm telling you that if you are ever going to be a whole person, you have to"
497,120683206.9,Other,i'll be ok with people discriminating blacks and gays and all that too
497,120683213.4,Other,we'll all be ok with it
497,120683215.6,Other,and accept it
497,120683228.1,Other,and set the stage to resume those practicies
497,120683232.7,Edgwired,LOL
497,120683244.7,Edgwired,now that's a little bit far
497,120683250.1,Other,mind
497,120683256.8,Other,social acceptance
497,120683269,Other,that's where all those are rooted
497,120683270.2,Edgwired,nobody is going to think it's ok to rape someone because i wore this halloween costume
497,120683275.7,Edgwired,and
497,120683282,Other,i'm not saying they will
497,120683289.5,Edgwired,making fun of blacks and gays is exactly what halloween is about
497,120683298.5,Other,victims
497,120683308,Edgwired,halloween is about terror
497,120683316.8,Edgwired,or
497,120683323.5,Edgwired,being the instrument of violence
497,120683329.6,Edgwired,or making victims
497,120683348.7,Edgwired,it works on SO MANY LEVELS
497,120683445.7,Edgwired,halloween is how children lose their fear of all the things that scare them. so why is that wrong for adults?
497,120683473.8,Other,"yes, if you isolate your angle... that works"
497,120683494,Other,"but there are other angles which, in my mind, make it innappropriate"
497,120683517.2,Other,and that's why it is YOUR party
497,120683521.7,Edgwired,"dude, i KNOW it's inappropriate."
497,120683528.4,Edgwired,but that's the point!
497,120683551.1,Other,i just think that telling someone to not take rape seriously is fucked up
497,120683571.3,Other,"and essentially, that is what you have to do in order to go to a party where someone is dressed up as rape"
497,120683628.2,Edgwired,i don't think you're taking rape seriously enough if you're limited to that point of view
497,120683637.9,Edgwired,i'm taking it dead serious
497,120683639.2,Other,i don't think many people are actually going to think about the issue when they see it
497,120683652,Other,it isn't a question of how you are going to view yourself
497,120683661.4,Edgwired,sure it is
497,120683665.5,Other,it is a question of how others will
497,120683669.1,Edgwired,exactly!
497,120683673.6,Other,right
497,120683677.1,Edgwired,who will get it?
497,120683680.2,Edgwired,i don't know
497,120683691.1,Edgwired,but even if five people out of 150 people get it
497,120683695.5,Edgwired,then the idea is a success
497,120683702.8,Edgwired,because it's communicated on the deepest levels
497,120683713.1,Other,regardless of the 145 you offend
497,120683719.4,Edgwired,definitely
497,120683724.2,Edgwired,that's what art is
497,120683733.8,Edgwired,or at least one very important aspect of it
497,120683772.9,Edgwired,for example:
497,120683774.4,Edgwired,http://www.wetterlinggallery.com/archive/nathalia/nathalia_main.htm
497,120683813.5,Edgwired,"Most people who see Nathalia's pictures for the first time are impressed by how beautiful they are. It takes a few seconds before you start to wonder how they have been made. A photo-montage? Some kind of digital manipulation? When you look closer, there is something slightly distorted in the rabbit's expression. Something slightly abnormal about the face of the cat. Slowly you realise that the animal is dead, that the animal has died for the sake of the picture. Is this acceptable? One can, of course, choose to think that it is always wrong to kill animals in the name of art. That nothing can defend Nathalia Edenmont. But if you feel more doubtful, we would very much like to explain Nathalia's reasoning, and how we at Wetterling Gallery argue when we exhibit her art. Art arouses thoughts and poses questions that are necessary. Nathalia's beautiful pictures are frightening in the same way that many other beautiful things hide some sort of suffering. One can enjoy beautiful exteriors, or one can go beneath the surface and find things that perhaps you do not want to know about. If Nathalia's pictures had been repugnant, it would have been easy to reject them. But now they are so beautiful - and the insight into the reality behind them gives rise to thoughts about people's shallowness and double standards. Many of us eat meat, wear leather or use make-up that has been tested on animals, without this arousing especially strong reactions. But when a picture shows a dead rabbit, all hell breaks loose. Nathalia grew up in the former Soviet Union, and she has a razor sharp eye for paradoxes and gaps in our western morals. She is not the first to use dead animals in her works of art - that has been done at least since the 1700s, but she is a contemporary debater who provokes questions which nowadays everyone should ask themselves. Her pictures tell lies in front of our faces, but they are not alone in this - the lies exist all around us every day, without us questioning them. There is nothing illegal in Nathalia's art. She has killed the animals in as humane a way as possible. Has she been guilty of a moral crime? We do not think so. We think that art is of vital importance."

497,120683874.3,Other,reading
497,120683878.3,Other,on the webpage now
497,120684070.4,Other,i get it
497,120684085.8,Other,i don't expect people to be comfortable with it
497,120684111.6,Other,and I don't know why one would go to a party where they were uncomfortable
497,120684116,Other,doesn't sound like a good time
497,120684167.3,Edgwired,the type of people who i want at my party are people who will be ok with it
497,120684174.1,Edgwired,even if they think it's distasteful
497,120684178.4,Other,aight
497,120684480.4,Edgwired,"if maria and al and imri get pissed off about it, i'll just go as a housewife"
497,120684504.1,Other,go as what you want
497,120684519.8,Edgwired,"nah, the party is all of ours"
497,120684528.9,Edgwired,even though i'd enjoy being a problem
497,120684536.7,Edgwired,i'm not going out of my way to annoy them
497,120684560.4,Edgwired,"i think if anyone won't be ok with it, it will be al"
497,120684565.5,Edgwired,i'll ask him what he thinks
497,120684594,Edgwired,it's still a brilliant costume
497,120685498.5,Other,"well, let me know if you change your costume"
497,120685503,Edgwired,ha
497,120685514,Other,seriously
497,120685519.6,Edgwired,i know
497,120685522.3,Edgwired,i just think it's funny
497,120685530.2,Other,i probably would too
497,120685554.6,Other,if it didn't seriously affect me
497,120685778.6,Edgwired,you can tell suzanne that i think hating on someone's creativity is pretty criminal
497,120685787.1,Other,i'll not
497,120687304.1,Other,she isn't hating on it anyway... just doesn't want to be at the party
497,120687343.8,Edgwired,"i'll go as matthew shepard""?"
497,120687348.7,Other,haha
497,120687360.2,Edgwired,mocking my creativity
497,120687415.3,Other,seems valid to me
497,120687416.4,Other,par
497,120687448.4,Edgwired,"nah, her intention is different"
497,120687470,Other,"she was making a good point, in my opinion"
497,120687502.4,Other,i thought it was a great example to put it in another perspective
497,120687513.5,Other,same as if i went as a black slave
497,120687521,Other,or a KKK member
497,120687532.1,Edgwired,i think all of those are valid halloween costumes
497,120687539.4,Other,aight
497,120687540.8,Edgwired,i think trying to be moral about halloween is pretty ridiculous
497,120687541.7,Other,and that's fine
497,120687550.4,Other,that's fine too
497,120687557.9,Other,we're free to do all that
497,120687569.1,Edgwired,LOL
497,120687578.9,Edgwired,yeah
497,120687590.8,Other,nobody told you not to do whatever you want
497,120687638.2,Edgwired,"nah, you just made it three times harder to pull off"
497,120687650.9,Other,i did nothing of the sort
497,120687670.5,Edgwired,sure
497,120687673.1,Edgwired,you did
497,120687692.2,Edgwired,"to pull something like this off, you have to own the idea"
497,120687703.5,Edgwired,and casting doubt all over it makes it harder to pull off
497,120687734.2,Other,"if anything, i made it easier"
497,120687746.2,Other,cause you justified it to probably the toughest critic
497,120687747.5,Other,already
497,120687763.8,Other,believe me... you own it
497,120687768.3,Edgwired,LOL
497,120687778.3,Edgwired,"yeah, i'm tempted to do it now out of spite"
497,120687788.7,Other,that's fine too
497,120687791.2,Other,really
497,120687800.2,Other,personally i just don't give a shit
497,120687808.1,Other,when it comes down to it
497,120687813,Other,i'd go either way
497,120687837.8,Edgwired,and for my second act i'll be playing the party of Joey Ramone
497,120687848.9,Other,"do i think it's appropriate, not really,, but that's just my opinion, and it wouldn't stop me from going"
497,120687854.8,Other,i dont' even know who joey ramone is
497,120687862.7,Other,didn't know who matthew shepard was
497,120687884.6,Edgwired,that's more the angle i'm going for
497,120687888.1,Edgwired,tolerance
497,120687902.5,Edgwired,joey ramone was the front man for the quintessential punk bank
497,120687904,Edgwired,band
497,120687922.2,Other,"dude,,, i get the experiement part of it"
497,120687932,Other,i get the artistic expression
497,120687957.2,Other,"and if it were not for this conversation, i wouldn't have given it much thought at all"
497,120687973.3,Other,"but, when i started to think about it,,, I didn't agree with it"
497,120687977,Other,that's all
497,120688114.2,Edgwired,i just cannot get past the fact that that very reaction is the most raw expression of exactly what a scary fucking halloween costume is all about.
497,120688147.2,Other,halloween started as a celebration of the dead
497,120688158,Edgwired,almost right
497,120688165.7,Edgwired,halloween is a celebration of demons
497,120688180.9,Edgwired,all-saints day is the day that follows
497,120688264.5,Other,all-souls day
497,120688272.5,Other,another related day
497,120688408.6,Edgwired,some dude is IMing me in italian
497,120688428.2,Other,why
497,120688436.7,Edgwired,he wants a copy of I Robot in Divx
497,120688446.8,Edgwired,i have no idea where he got my nic
497,120688459,Other,werd
497,120688461.2,Other,weird
497,120688464.2,Edgwired,very
497,120688471.7,Edgwired,esp since i don't speak a word
497,120688473.5,Other,see what he thinks of your costume
497,120688475.5,Other,;)
497,120688483.3,Edgwired,i posted a topic on the forum
497,120688488.5,Edgwired,i really wanted it to be a total surprise
497,120688491.1,Other,dude
497,120688493.3,Other,you should have
497,120688495,Edgwired,but now i've got to take a poll
497,120688497.7,Other,fuck that
497,120688500.9,Edgwired,i haven't told anyone what it's going to be
497,120688506.7,Edgwired,just that it's controversial
497,120688524.4,Other,"right,,, that doesn't accurately get the point accross tho"
497,120688526.8,Other,"whatever,,,"
497,120688551.1,Other,bottom line... just let me know what you decide
497,120688572.7,Edgwired,i think Al's gonna balk
497,120688585.4,Other,i wonder why
497,120688593.8,Edgwired," Of course, there is such a thing as an inappropriate costume.Plenty of things are sacred, until they are belittled by human neglegence.Halloween is not a day meant to celebrate everything that is wrong with our culture. Thanksgiving is more along those lines.
497,120693565.4,Edgwired,imri is totally fine with it
497,120696029,Edgwired,ok
497,120696030.3,Edgwired,i'm doing it
497,120696035.5,Edgwired,nobody seems to mind

543,123692608.4,Edgwired,she feeds me this ration of bullshit
543,123692612.5,Edgwired,instead of being helpful
543,123692631.8,Edgwired,i've been trying to be nice to the loan officer
543,123692638.4,Edgwired,even though she isn't the one that makes the decision
543,123692651,Edgwired,because she's the one that supposed to be on my team
543,123692651.8,Edgwired,but
543,123692664.6,Edgwired,they definitely aren't acting like they're on my team
543,123692677.9,Edgwired,and every time i call i get pissed off

543,123692823.5,Edgwired,"Michelle says that ""Anne will review it in the morning and blah blah"

543,123692870.6,Other,how much are you applying for?
543,123692873.3,Edgwired,but hasn't volunteered to help me in any fucking way
543,123692876.5,Edgwired,"18,000"
543,123692883.6,Edgwired,in getting the stupid papers faxed over
543,123692887.2,Edgwired,she's really pissing me off
543,123692888.2,Edgwired,because
543,123692890.5,Edgwired,she acts like
543,123692893.8,Edgwired,i'm the problem
543,123692910,Other,sounds like both of these people are worthless

543,123692962.5,Other,like... a lettter of disgust
543,123692968.4,Edgwired,when i first started with this
543,123692969.8,Edgwired,she was like
543,123692971.5,Edgwired,Oh Sure
543,123692974.6,Edgwired,send your paperwork in

543,123693005.7,Other,or bank

543,123693069.4,Other,just do that

543,123693093.7,Edgwired,Anne is in the corporate office over on Market Street
543,123693100.3,Edgwired,which makes me wonder if there is a different one
543,123693110.7,Edgwired,i got her name from a friend of mine who is the branch manager of Society Hill
543,123693139.8,Other,"so, this anne character is the end all be all of loans?"
543,123693146.6,Other,i don't get the advantage of dealing with her
543,123693147.8,Edgwired,she might be
543,123693160.9,Edgwired,the only one that i had was that she was a contact of Bobbys
543,123693166.1,Edgwired,but they're really fucking up on me
543,123693184.3,Edgwired,and i really think Michelle is being rude
543,123693186.6,Other,"well, ask your friend"
543,123693198.7,Other,see what kind of information you can get
543,123693210.4,Other,about the process and if you could/should go to another branch

548,123950916.5,Other,but i was still surprised
548,123950948.1,Edgwired,which plan did you choose?
548,123950957.7,Other,39.99 national
548,123950965.1,Other,so. 450 anytime rollover minutes
548,123950969.9,Other,5000 night and weekend
548,123950976.8,Other,free mobile to mobile
548,123950987.1,Other,the thing is.... you pay for text messaging

548,123951002.1,Other,but fyi
548,123951030.6,Edgwired,do you know how many minutes you were using before
548,123951067.3,Other,like 300 a month of my anytime
548,123951080.7,Other,and maybe 1000 of night and weekend????
548,123951082.8,Other,maybe
548,123951088.8,Edgwired,hmmm
548,123951105.1,Edgwired,i have no idea how much i use
548,123951125.5,Edgwired,what a fucking great idea that was
548,123951144.1,Edgwired,getting people to try to figure out how much they use the phone in order to pay for it
548,123951147.7,Edgwired,you're too low
548,123951149.4,Edgwired,you're fucked

548,123951191.1,Edgwired,maria had an $800 phone bill
548,123951208.6,Other,well
548,123951216.9,Other,one does have to be reasonable

548,123951236.8,Edgwired,yes
548,123951238.7,Other,i still don't get it tho
548,123951247.2,Other,if you know you are having a problem
548,123951256.4,Other,you should probably monitor its effects
548,123951287.7,Edgwired,i don't think anybody can reasonably expect an $800 phone bill
548,123951300.6,Edgwired,that's extortion
548,123951322.9,Other,sure... i'm just saying there had to be signs
548,123951377.5,Edgwired,have you ever heard of anything else where you pay for a service and then pay 20 times more because that service is broken?
548,123951409.3,Other,i don't know the details of the situation
548,123951412.7,Other,no i have not
548,123951416.9,Other,but there has to be something to it
548,123951440.8,Other,any carrier i have ever been with has always removed dropped calls
548,123951448.8,Other,and what i'm saying is....
548,123951455.7,Other,to rack up $800
548,123951467,Other,that has to be a lot of dropped calls
548,123951472.7,Edgwired,yup
548,123951477.5,Other,so
548,123951503.8,Other,one had ample warning
548,123951512.1,Other,the problem didn't surface from nowhere
548,123951526.3,Edgwired,well they stuck it to her
548,123951528.8,Other,yes
548,123951533.9,Other,sounds like it

548,123951591,Other,nationwide/regional?
548,123951599.8,Edgwired,nationwide
548,123951612.9,Other,are you contemplating more minutes than the $40?
548,123951619.6,Edgwired,probably
548,123951678.2,Edgwired,i thought the 850 plan might work
548,123951683.4,Edgwired,might be way too much too
548,123951684.5,Other,and you are thinking of the nationwide to cover your trips to TN?
548,123951711,Edgwired,i just hate the idea of roaming
548,123951738,Other,"right,,, but you can look at the map and determine if you actually need nationwide"
548,123951764.8,Edgwired,how much does it save you?\
548,123951777.3,Other,$40 would get you 600 min
548,123951785.2,Other,and unlimited nights/weekends
548,123951790.6,Edgwired,no rollover
548,123951807,Other,yes

548,123951848.7,Edgwired,yeah
548,123951871.9,Other,might as well do the $50 and get the 600 anytime if that is what you want
548,123951878.8,Other,how much do you use your phone?
548,123951896.8,Edgwired,"not much, but that's b/c i hated it"
548,123951910.8,Edgwired,would use it more for long distance
548,123951929.2,Edgwired,and i really wish they had a better data plan
548,123951973.4,Other,so you could use your phone to surf the internet?
548,123951986.6,Edgwired,"yeah, mapquest when i'm on the road"

548,123952683.4,Edgwired,so i think i'm going to have to find a different loan officer at commerce bank
548,123952692.9,Other,i'd say so
548,123952717.1,Edgwired,"would you a) write a nasty letter to the original, useless loan officer and copy customer service OR b) not write a nasty letter to the original, useless loan officer and copy customer service"
548,123952776.6,Other,i'd not write a letter
548,123952783.4,Other,that's not going to get you a loan
548,123952820.4,Other,"but i *would* use the ""oh so terrible experience and poor customer service"" when talking to your next loan officer"
548,123952855.9,Other,i think that's the only way you can use it to your advantage
548,123952860.8,Edgwired,how to find?
548,123952876.6,Edgwired,i'm thinking i have to call customer service to get a new name

548,123953449.1,Edgwired,before the loan
548,123953505.2,Other,well
548,123953513.2,Other,you can't get a business loan if you have no business

573,124660851.1,Edgwired,"According to court testimony, Pickard and Apperson previously manufactured LSD in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where every five weeks the lab produced about 2.2 pounds of LSD, approximately 10 million doses that cost less than one cent a dose to produce and would sell for as much as $10 a dose."

573,124660884.5,Other,damn
573,124660937.9,Edgwired,The proof of the significance of these prosecutions and convictions lies in the fact that LSD availability in the United States was reduced by 95 % in the two years following their arrest.

573,124662337.4,Edgwired,"Wes, I had lost the respect that I had for you some time ago, but we're now at a point that I want you to remove yourself from my circle. Do not talk about me to other people. Do not tell other people how I may or may not feel because you definitely don't have the ability to speak with my voice. Do not involve me in your pathetic life. Do not contact me again. - Mikee"

575,124735131.8,Edgwired,this is not something i'm going to stress myself out about
575,124735139.6,Edgwired,at least we're aware of it
575,124735142.8,Other,yeah

575,124735430.2,Other,at the same time
575,124735438,Other,do you want to be with someone where you can never touch that
575,124735439.7,Other,or agree with it
575,124735463.9,Edgwired,"not really, which i guess is why i didn't stop shaking the tree"
575,124735469.1,Other,yeah
575,124735483.1,Other,"i mean,, ultimately, sure,, maybe you should have approached it with more caution"
575,124735484.1,Other,but
575,124735493.8,Other,you were going to get to the same place one way or another
575,124735502.6,Other,and now that you are at this crossroads
575,124735524.1,Other,you just have to decide for yourself if you are willing to be with that person
575,124735542.4,Edgwired,it's not my decision to make
575,124735544,Edgwired,it's his
575,124735546.2,Other,sure
575,124735549.3,Edgwired,i respect his choice
575,124735554.7,Edgwired,i dunno if he can respect mine

575,124735630.8,Edgwired,sure
575,124735633,Other,that you don't and won't have a problem with his choice
575,124735634,Edgwired,immediately
575,124735635.6,Edgwired,it was fun
575,124735643,Other,his mindset

575,124735654.5,Edgwired,i don't
575,124735659.2,Edgwired,i went to his church on sunday

575,124735681.1,Other,yeah... you are waiting
575,124735683.9,Other,for him to decide

575,124735703.2,Other,it really sux tho
575,124735711.5,Edgwired,a lot
575,124735713,Other,the whole having to bite your tongue deal
575,124735720,Other,and shut up
575,124735727,Edgwired,most of the time possible
575,124735735.2,Edgwired,but not alone in bed in the dark
575,124735739.3,Other,"and accept that a person doesn't believe the same, etc etc"
575,124735742.9,Other,yeah
575,124735743.6,Other,well
575,124735749.1,Other,that works for a while
575,124735754,Other,but then you start to second guess
575,124735812.8,Other,"that's why i said ""this person"" earlier"
575,124735820.7,Edgwired,?
575,124735822.3,Other,because... you have to step aside from ANDY
575,124735830.1,Other,if you think about it in terms of ANDY
575,124735836.7,Other,then you are going to get all warm inside
575,124735842.2,Other,and be willing to sacrifice anything
575,124735849.7,Other,know what i mean?
575,124735855.9,Edgwired,yeah

575,124735919.1,Edgwired,anybody who chooses to be with me is going to have to be able to spar a little
575,124735936.2,Edgwired,and i've let it go this far without turning my head against him
575,124735940.6,Other,yeah
575,124735945.9,Edgwired,but it had to happen one way or the other
575,124735963.4,Edgwired,and it was really a non-confrontational way of doing it
575,124735994.6,Other,shit man... i have no idea
575,124736000.3,Other,i mean
575,124736003.3,Other,honestly..

575,124736043.9,Other,i just don't know
575,124736049.3,Edgwired,compromise is the only way two people can stay together
575,124736053,Other,yeah

575,124736058.5,Edgwired,hA
575,124736068.5,Other,because compromise leaves you wanting
575,124736083.2,Edgwired,that's a good thing though
575,124736087.5,Edgwired,because if you were satisfied
575,124736088.7,Edgwired,what then?
575,124736110.7,Other,then i could walk around being completely happy with that part of my life
575,124736113.5,Other,no questions
575,124736123.7,Other,no reason to look at anything else
575,124736125.5,Edgwired,"nah, it would drive you nuts"

575,124736201.1,Other,not like we did anything
575,124736213.1,Other,but if either of our bf/gf would have seen us
575,124736217.2,Other,it would not have been pleasant
575,124736236.9,Edgwired,w/e

608,133124467,Edgwired,tough call
608,133124479.1,Other,and
608,133124492.9,Other,they'll probably look at the loans I took when determining my financial aid for summer
608,133124495.1,Other,know what i mean?
608,133124513.7,Other,"like... "" well, you must not need it that bad... you didn't even take your loans in the spring"
608,133124521.8,Edgwired,eh
608,133124524.8,Edgwired,i don't know about that
608,133124529.1,Edgwired,you could argue that you need it more
608,133124534.7,Edgwired,since you didn't take a loan
608,133124580.6,Other,well
608,133124587.2,Other,but then they'd say... we'll give you more loan now
608,133124594.9,Other,becasue you didn't take those loans then
608,133124609.3,Other,"basically, i got the director to hook up my penn grant up by an additional $2K"
608,133124614,Other,this semester
608,133124626.3,Other,and he justified it on the system as because i was goign to have to take more loans later
608,133124643.1,Edgwired,so take it?
608,133124657.2,Edgwired,remind me the diff between subsidized and unsubsidized
608,133124683.2,Other,govt pays interest on sub
608,133124690.8,Other,interest accrues starting now on unsub

608,133124727.4,Edgwired,i mena
608,133124728.5,Edgwired,mean
608,133124738,Edgwired,i really don't see much of a difference
608,133124744.5,Edgwired,if you've got the money now
608,133124747.2,Other,esp since i'm gonna be done in 5 months

608,133124755.6,Other,sure
608,133124758.9,Other,the difference is
608,133124765.4,Other,that when they go to give me loan or grant
608,133124769.2,Other,for this summer
608,133124785.8,Other,i'm thinking i am more likely to get higher grant amounts if they see that i'm more extended in terms of loans
608,133124796,Other,than if i opted not to take loans in spring semester
608,133124806.4,Other,know what i mean?
608,133124810.4,Edgwired,how are you going to hide the cash you have on hand?

697,124213441.4,Other,yup

758,100744614,Other,I do
758,100744621.6,Other,I just can't love him
758,100744630.1,Other,he hurts me too much
758,100744637.3,Other,he's very schizo
758,100744648.7,Edgwired,right
758,100744660.6,Edgwired,that's weird
758,100744667.1,Other,it is wierd
758,100744688.5,Other,but i also realized that my respect for him was always characterized by what others thought of him
758,100744700,Other,and i can't worry about that anymore
758,100744718.3,Other,I used to feel guilty if I talked to him
758,100744731.5,Other,all the more reason to treat him like a secret addiction
758,100744747.1,Edgwired,ok
758,100744752.6,Edgwired,so at least you can objectify it
758,100744759.3,Other,yup yup
758,100744765.2,Other,i'm fine trust me
758,100744777.5,Other,still have the old impulses around him
758,100744786.7,Other,but getting better...
758,100744814.7,Edgwired,so you want to see him again?
758,100744830.6,Other,not especially
758,100744838.3,Other,i don't care either way
758,100744846.3,Other,i'm not mad at him anymore
758,100744858.7,Other,but i don't love him that way anymore either
758,100744865.6,Edgwired,ok
758,100744872.5,Edgwired,so did you get to help him with his problem?
758,100744877.6,Other,but i'm also not worried about hurting teddy
758,100744887,Other,well that's the bad part
758,100744910.8,Other,I said
758,100744919.3,Other,"what's your problem, TR?"
758,100744922.2,Other,and he said
758,100744938,Other,"well, I've already found the solution"
758,100744955.6,Other,"don't worry ""beautiful"
758,100744959.5,Other,blah blah blah
758,100744973.6,Other,so he was trying to obviously lay it on thick
758,100744976.1,Other,and I said
758,100744980.8,Other,"truss me,"
758,100744988.9,Other,"I AIN""T NOBODY'S SOLUTION"
758,100745000.7,Other,Caroline
758,100745026.1,Edgwired,whoa
758,100745030.1,Edgwired,so...
758,100745033.1,Other,he said
758,100745039.3,Other,"aw, don't hate me"
758,100745046.9,Other,"and I said, u know I could never"
758,100745057.4,Other,"but we can't ever go back, TR. NEver."
758,100745073.1,Other,"Now I can talk to you, but only as a FRIEND"
758,100745079.5,Other,and if that's not enough
758,100745082.8,Other,hang up
758,100745090.9,Other,and he said (after some silence)
758,100745093.9,Other,I gotta go
758,100745100.7,Other,but I'm gonna keep on trying
758,100745112.6,Edgwired,so he wants to get back together with you again?
758,100745116,Other,no
758,100745116.7,Edgwired,and he made up a reason to call?
758,100745130.5,Other,he gets the same hankering I do
758,100745138.1,Other,we pine for each other
758,100745147.4,Other,it happens every march/feb
758,100745155.4,Other,but this time I had to resist
758,100745168.3,Other,because I can't go thru it again
758,100745174.5,Edgwired,good choice
758,100745189,Edgwired,i don't like him so much
758,100745192.5,Other,no no
758,100745195.8,Other,no one does
758,100745199.7,Other,only me
758,100745203.9,Other,only I see the light
758,100745211.1,Other,but I'm not resisting for you
758,100745223,Other,"or for Dan, or Tedi or whoever"
758,100745225.9,Other,but for me
758,100745235,Other,but I can honestly say
758,100745241.8,Other,I've never loved anyone like that
758,100745248.8,Other,no one does it to me like he does

807,107104136.7,Edgwired,do you need to talk about it or are you ok with it?
807,107104146.6,Other,I want to write it out
807,107104151.2,Edgwired,tell me
807,107104151.7,Other,and I can do both with you
807,107104154.4,Other,u sure?
807,107104156.7,Edgwired,sure
807,107104161.1,Other,because I can just write it
807,107104171.2,Other,oh well
807,107104174.2,Other,so here goes
807,107104182.3,Other,after sex
807,107104184.7,Other,last night
807,107104189.4,Other,I said to wes
807,107104199,Other,your body turns me on
807,107104219.3,Other,and he immediately jumped up and put his underwear on
807,107104221,Other,!
807,107104226.8,Other,so I didn't say anything
807,107104228.6,Edgwired,whoa
807,107104231.3,Other,I know
807,107104241,Other,so then he goes to put this stupid movie on
807,107104254.4,Other,and I sat up and shut my powerbook
807,107104258.3,Other,slammed it shut
807,107104269.6,Other,and he stood there with his mouth open
807,107104272.5,Other,and I said NO
807,107104276.6,Other,NO deflections
807,107104295.4,Edgwired,good
807,107104305.6,Other,and he said ok
807,107104315.1,Other,can we at least smoke a cigarette?
807,107104325.1,Other,"no problem I say, and start getting dressed"
807,107104329.7,Other,so then
807,107104335.9,Other,I said to him
807,107104339,Other,Wes
807,107104360.2,Other,you're never going to find what you're looking for if you don't have it yourself
807,107104365.5,Other,and he said
807,107104373.4,Other,"I'm just mental, I can't help it"
807,107104378.8,Edgwired,ARGH
807,107104384,Other,"so I said, I'm surprised at you Wes"
807,107104392.5,Other,I thought you were smarter than that
807,107104396.5,Other,!
807,107104402.4,Other,and walked downstairs
807,107104410.2,Other,leaving him in his underwear
807,107104421.8,Other,"(and of course, I looked gorgeous)"
807,107104426.4,Edgwired,heh
807,107104430.7,Other,:P
807,107104437.9,Other,so he rushes down
807,107104442.4,Other,and sits on the step
807,107104444.4,Other,and sighs
807,107104447.1,Other,and I said
807,107104452.6,Other,what are you looking for?
807,107104455.4,Other,he said
807,107104461.4,Other,someone to finish my sentences
807,107104465.3,Other,for me
807,107104471.2,Other,and Misa does that
807,107104474.2,Other,and I said
807,107104482.4,Other,so you're lazy then?
807,107104487.1,Edgwired,ha
807,107104487.3,Other,:D

807,107104560.3,Edgwired,i love you toof
807,107104569.3,Other,but then I knew were beating around the bush again
807,107104583.4,Other,and even tho wes CLAIMS he hates an elephant in the room
807,107104598.6,Other,I said Wes
807,107104609.4,Other,I am falling for you
807,107104617.2,Other,and I know you are falling for me
807,107104630.7,Other,but it's not my feelings are not your responsibility
807,107104646.9,Other,I mean my feelings aren't your responsibility
807,107104649.8,Other,just as you
807,107104656.8,Other,can't hold me responsible
807,107104667.6,Other,IF YOU WON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO FEEL YOURS
807,107104674.1,Other,:-o
807,107104700.8,Edgwired,"here is your mirror, go stare at it for a while"
807,107104726.7,Other,TOUGH huh?
807,107104738.3,Edgwired,did he have a response?
807,107104747.8,Other,deflections
807,107104751,Other,kept saying
807,107104754.8,Other,silly shit
807,107104758.3,Other,but he did say
807,107104764.1,Other,but the thing is
807,107104772.3,Other,I am falling for you know
807,107104773.6,Other,now
807,107104781.6,Other,but I might be falling for Misa in a month
807,107104785.6,Other,:(
807,107104789.8,Other,I dunno mikee
807,107104796.1,Other,I don't think I can love this man
807,107104801.7,Other,there are too many obstacles
807,107104808.6,Other,he has terrible addictions
807,107104812.2,Other,and he loves them
807,107104819.1,Edgwired,yeah
807,107104826,Other,and he doesn't want to be completely open
807,107104828.6,Other,he's scared
807,107104847.7,Edgwired,"i think it is good to do for the sex and attention, but i really don't think you're going to enjoy dragging him out of his headspace"
807,107104855.6,Other,no
807,107104865.6,Other,it's not even that I won't only enjoy it
807,107104875.5,Other,it's not possible
807,107104891.6,Other,while I could definitely rock Wes' world
807,107104900.5,Other,he wants Misa because she is prolly funny
807,107104904.2,Other,and smart
807,107104908.6,Other,but as he told me
807,107104914.3,Other,she's a pothead
807,107104926.4,Other,he wants someone with just as much honesty as he's willing to take
807,107104934.4,Other,and I am too much for him
807,107104936.6,Other,!
807,107104942.8,Other,I AM SO FUCKING CONCETED
807,107104945.6,Edgwired,no
807,107104947.1,Edgwired,darling
807,107104952.7,Edgwired,that gets right to the point of it
807,107104959.6,Edgwired,you are definitely too much for him
807,107104968.4,Edgwired,he's afraid his head is going to break open
807,107104971,Other,as long as I remember this
807,107104974.7,Other,your right
807,107104988.3,Edgwired,and fitting everything you tell him inside of it at once
807,107104996.7,Edgwired,scares the shit out of him
807,107105005.7,Other,right
807,107105011.8,Edgwired,"the words i'm concerned with are , ""i might... in a month"
807,107105016,Edgwired,what kind of bullshit is that
807,107105016.7,Other,but my heart will still be broken
807,107105019.8,Other,I know
807,107105025.2,Other,he wants to love this girl
807,107105028.2,Edgwired,so
807,107105033.7,Other,so what babe?
807,107105037.8,Other,he's committed to her
807,107105039.3,Edgwired,i'm saying
807,107105046.7,Other,he needs to hold on to those things
807,107105053.4,Other,he thinks that is BOND
807,107105056.2,Other,u know?
807,107105059.7,Edgwired,ha
807,107105077.9,Other,he hasn't had his Tedi relationship
807,107105083.3,Other,he's only had his TR
807,107105085.6,Other,get it?
807,107105090,Edgwired,i'm saying recognize him for what he really is right now and how that is NOT what you want or need or would fulfill you and keep your heart intact
807,107105114.3,Other,the mind understands that
807,107105130.6,Other,but perhaps the greatest mystery of our being is that the mind speaks a different language than the heart
807,107105134.7,Other,:-/
807,107105141.2,Edgwired,and we tend to follow the heart
807,107105146.2,Other,sniff
807,107105150.8,Edgwired,well
807,107105161.5,Other,I'm gonna be fine now
807,107105166.4,Other,don't you worry
807,107105167.2,Edgwired,it's basically impossible not to love a person like that because you know the potential
807,107105174.5,Other,right
807,107105179,Other,but
807,107105189.2,Other,I think Wes doesn't want to go there
807,107105198,Other,it's not even a possibility
807,107105206.6,Other,in some ways he's a hypocrit
807,107105210.3,Other,u know?
807,107105230.4,Edgwired,"yeah, he knows better i think"
807,107105246,Edgwired,choosing to remain a child
807,107105249.9,Edgwired,when he knows he's a man
807,107105264.4,Other,he's still the fat kid
807,107105266.7,Other,hiding
807,107105274.8,Other,behind drugs alcohol
807,107105279.1,Other,his cat
807,107105285.2,Other,his fear
807,107105299.6,Edgwired,i think maybe he wasn't as afraid before
807,107105305,Edgwired,and let himself slide into it
807,107105311,Other,his last relationship?
807,107105317.7,Other,or when we first met?
807,107105318.9,Edgwired,before that
807,107105326,Other,OH I SEE
807,107105329.4,Other,that makes sense
807,107105334,Other,we slide into these things
807,107105338.4,Other,as we get older
807,107105341.1,Other,gotcha
807,107105357.7,Edgwired,"yeah, Bowling for Columbine syndrome"
807,107105366.3,Other,LOL
807,107105369.6,Other,you're so smart
807,107105374.3,Other,so what to do next?

807,107105395,Other,one thing tho
807,107105403.6,Other,that needs to asked once more
807,107105407.8,Edgwired,what
807,107105408.5,Other,two things actually
807,107105410.6,Other,first

807,107105423.6,Edgwired,yes
807,107105426.8,Edgwired,very

807,107105431.5,Edgwired,i swear
807,107105432,Other,:F
807,107105434.2,Edgwired,toof
807,107105434.6,Other,toof?
807,107105437.7,Edgwired,why does it matter
807,107105439.1,Other,LOL
807,107105442.7,Other,mikee
807,107105449.9,Other,don't think like a friend
807,107105451.7,Other,right now
807,107105454.4,Edgwired,k
807,107105455.3,Other,think like a fa

807,107105458.6,Other,:P
807,107105475.9,Edgwired,"you are superior to her in many, many ways, the LEASST of which is your physical beauty"
807,107105486.6,Other,Thank you
807,107105503.6,Other,I just want to say you are superior to everyone in EVERY WAY ALL THE DAMN TIME
807,107105505.7,Other,:D
807,107105513.2,Edgwired,meh
807,107105516.9,Edgwired,what's the second question
807,107105518.1,Other,swear it
807,107105520.1,Other,oh
807,107105532.1,Other,do you find it interesting that he MIGHT see her in a month?
807,107105542.1,Other,that she hasn't set the date yet?
807,107105546.1,Other,what's with that?
807,107105562.5,Edgwired,that's a tougher one
807,107105565.5,Edgwired,if it were me
807,107105575.2,Edgwired,it wouldn't suprise me because we operate on instinct
807,107105578.5,Edgwired,but it's not me
807,107105584.1,Edgwired,and if it's really that uncertain
807,107105591.2,Edgwired,up to the fates to decide whether it happens
807,107105594.6,Other,"what you mean, instinct?"
807,107105601.4,Edgwired,probably means it's not that set even if she DOES come
807,107105601.8,Other,you mean she'll come when its time
807,107105607.8,Edgwired,that's what i would do
807,107105609.5,Edgwired,but
807,107105614.1,Edgwired,i'm not so sure that's what's happening
807,107105615.2,Other,"he sees it as set, babe"
807,107105620.4,Other,seriously
807,107105626.4,Other,he says that at least to me
807,107105634.5,Edgwired,thing is
807,107105636,Other,hmmmm
807,107105640.9,Edgwired,would it really be that much of a struggle
807,107105646.5,Edgwired,if it was an intended thing?
807,107105657.6,Other,yes I see that
807,107105667.5,Other,but wes wants a human to cuddle with
807,107105672.5,Other,not his cat anymore
807,107105679.7,Other,so he's going to find a female feline
807,107105691.2,Other,who'll cuddle up with him when he's wasted
807,107105696.6,Other,and just purrrr
807,107105712.1,Edgwired,and he's going to upend this poor girl from TEXAS to have it?
807,107105713,Other,he's so everywhere
807,107105719.4,Other,YES
807,107105719.9,Edgwired,if she wants to move here
807,107105725.4,Other,he thinks this is it
807,107105727.4,Edgwired,she should fucking move here of her own accord
807,107105729.1,Other,I swear
807,107105740.8,Other,I think he wants to marry this girl
807,107105743.5,Other,deep down
807,107105749.1,Edgwired,MEH
807,107105767.1,Other,so boring
807,107105779.2,Other,I wish I could talk to Ian about this
807,107105784.7,Other,but I don't think that's fair
807,107105794,Edgwired,what do you think Ian could offer?
807,107105806,Other,background on Wes
807,107105816.5,Edgwired,yeah
807,107105818.6,Edgwired,that's what i thought
807,107105829.2,Other,and just insight that you and I don't have
807,107105837.2,Other,I want someone else to tell my WHY this girl

807,107105874,Edgwired,in the absence of Misa the situation would be exactly the same
807,107105882.8,Edgwired,she is only a very small part of his fear
807,107105883.6,Other,TRUE
807,107105895.2,Other,the situation is not what I am frustrated with
807,107105905.3,Other,it's my lack of a REAL chance
807,107105913.1,Other,because of SOME TOOFY GIRL
807,107105917.5,Edgwired,haha
807,107105917.8,Other,LOL

807,107106101.6,Edgwired,this is the type of mess that we choose to make our lives interesting with
807,107106106.3,Edgwired,it's the drama we crave
807,107106108.8,Edgwired,that we don't need
807,107106110.5,Edgwired,or really want
807,107106114.2,Edgwired,after the fact

809,107224476.3,Other,but he told wes that you must face conflict
809,107224491,Other,because otherwise it can land you on your face
809,107224495.9,Other,rather than your back
809,107224498.1,Other,or something
809,107224501.1,Other,and then he said
809,107224506.1,Other,with irony

809,107224518.1,Other,will become great friends
809,107224521.7,Other,;)
809,107224547.6,Edgwired,"There is an old Chinese proverb that reads, ""In every gain, there is a loss and in every loss there's a gain"" Fear is like that. Even the most brave fear something. Weights and balances, my friend. Fearing conflict is really the worse, though. Your others are just trivial things. Specifics that heal, like everything else, with time. But conflict, fearing conflict is the most debilitating of fears because it leaves you in a constant state of retreat. I write you this now really because a very good friend of mine shared in your phobia, and then one day, he simply dropped off. It really hurt me, and in some ways still lingers, because I never knew the reason why. And when we are left to our own devices to solve something that we simply cannot solve, then one's fear of a temperate conflict leaves another with lasting scars. All I am saying is don't fear conflict. Avoiding the situation brings greater suffering, and makes it last. You only go through this passage of life as this entity once, so why hide from it? Chase your windmills, motherfucka! -Don Q."

827,108434565.3,Edgwired,eh
827,108434575.1,Edgwired,actually i haven't been thinking about it specifically
827,108434587.4,Edgwired,only the general lack of options
827,108434601.7,Other,or the lack of general POSITIVE PERCEPTION
827,108434614.3,Edgwired,nope
827,108434626.7,Edgwired,i can be happy with what i have and have few options
827,108434684.2,Other,hmmmm
827,108434691.2,Other,i am thinking NO
827,108434697.5,Other,but only thou knows thyself
827,108434707.5,Edgwired,"generally, a very significant part of my days are spent in very ideal situations"
827,108434730.5,Edgwired,just not much changing
827,108434743.5,Edgwired,probably for lack to true desire to change much
827,108434744.2,Other,you're
827,108434745.6,Other,comfortable
827,108434758.7,Other,some of the very same things that apply to me and tedi
827,108434765.6,Other,apply to you and this situation....
827,108434767.7,Other,i think
827,108434771.7,Other,not trying to judge
827,108434775,Other,:F
827,108434904.2,Edgwired,"there's nothing to affect a change with yet, so i'm not that concerned about missing an opportunity"
827,108434995.7,Other,that wasn't the problem with me and tedi
827,108435000.8,Other,:-/
827,108435052.1,Edgwired,and yet when it finally adjusted you have several options to present themselves of their own accord
827,108435119.9,Other,not everything presents itself
827,108435123.9,Other,its is cultivated
827,108435177.4,Edgwired,"so far, cultivation has been a highly subconscious process for me"
827,108435250.6,Other,there is a world around u
827,108435263.3,Other,you lack of acknowledgement
827,108435273.4,Other,is incompatible with your desires for material comfort
827,108435330.9,Edgwired,"on the contrary, my lack of acknowledgement has led to a great deal of material comfort"
827,108435348.8,Edgwired,what i lack is emotional comfort
827,108435353.4,Other,dissertate please
827,108435354.3,Other,...
827,108435537.9,Edgwired,"how many people do you know that perform their workday in such places as the bath, the bed, a hammock, or under the shade of an umbrella? what's more, how many people do you know that travel at to far end of the earth? with some of the finest equipment and clothes available? at their own leisure? all *without* paying a great deal of attention to what most people consider their main concerns."
827,108435560.1,Other,material concerns=not monetary
827,108435568.7,Other,material concerns=expectations of others
827,108435574,Other,contradicted with your own
827,108435582.5,Other,#NAME?
827,108435584.2,Other,and self loathing
827,108435612.8,Edgwired,i don't know anyone that isn't self loathing
827,108435637.5,Edgwired,"in fact, i happen to believe it's a very basic characteristic of existence"
827,108435643.5,Edgwired,or at least consciousness
827,108435675.9,Other,u are wounded by the smiling slaves
827,108435684.6,Other,and the workplace is a place of
827,108435690.6,Other,vulnerability for you
827,108435700.2,Other,please accept my apology if I am being too forward
827,108435703.6,Other,:-/
827,108435773.5,Edgwired,the vulnerability in that respect affords me comforts in others that i wanted for a very long time
827,108435792.8,Other,must keep moving
827,108435795.1,Other,no?
827,108435815.6,Edgwired,we haven't seen anything to move to yet
827,108435822.3,Edgwired,full circle
827,108435897.6,Other,u and I are not in the same mind fram
827,108435897.6,Other,e
827,108435900.1,Other,for once I am thinking in a very Junging
827,108435902.4,Other,Jungian
827,108435905.8,Other,Freudian way
827,108435911.3,Other,u are thinking my usual
827,108435913.3,Other,Buddha
827,108435973.8,Edgwired,"i'm more satisfied now with my ability to make decisions than i have ever been before, and that method of making decisions involves intuiting out the best options, and up to now i haven't felt many viable options, and it's more of an observation than an anxiety that such things happen to be this way"
827,108435992,Other,but practice of decision making should extend into your own matters
827,108435997.1,Other,all of them no?
827,108436007,Other,practice...action....balance
827,108436097.6,Edgwired,knowing when not to force a decision is often more important than affecting lateral movement
827,108436138.6,Other,knowing when to fashion the outcome is better than claiming detachment
827,108436150.7,Other,often comes as lazy when it mixes with certain situations
827,108436269.8,Edgwired,"eh, most of my best experiences were fashioned under the pressures of doing nothing"
827,108436297.6,Other,you're confusing terms
827,108436309.1,Other,fashioning unequal to presssure
827,108436316.2,Other,fashioning USING pressure
827,108436374,Edgwired,i'm not sure our statements differ
827,108436408.6,Other,fashioned under the pressures of doing nothing
827,108436412.3,Other,denotes to me
827,108436417.7,Other,subsisting under conditions
827,108436426.3,Other,ashioning USING pressure
827,108436440.6,Other,denotes using the force to one's advantage
827,108436443.1,Other,actively
827,108436473.7,Edgwired,doing nothing creates the pressures with which to fashion
827,108436494.3,Edgwired,the world externalizes into extremes
827,108436502.3,Edgwired,which bring upon action
827,108436557.9,Edgwired,"my point is, i'm not under the extreme of anything"
827,108436562.7,Edgwired,at this moment
827,108436569.7,Edgwired,i have nothing to act upon
827,108436591.9,Other,ok then
827,108436600.8,Other,shall we question connotations
827,108436603.6,Other,of subsisting
827,108436608.4,Other,and EXisting
827,108436621.1,Other,I think u are CHOSING THIS:
827,108436628.4,Other,i have nothing to act upon
827,108436703.9,Edgwired,qualified: i have nothing to act upon which improves my quality of existence
827,108436740.4,Edgwired,and so what if i choose that?
827,108436755.7,Edgwired,it would take something major to improve at this point
827,108436759.9,Other,how so?
827,108436760,Other,I would argue the emotional
827,108436802.4,Other,and why
827,108436810.3,Other,don't u have the major in u?
827,108436820,Other,u have been given months of meditation
827,108436857.6,Edgwired,and i find that i'm well placed
827,108436861.6,Edgwired,i just finished the major
827,108436864.7,Edgwired,quite literally
827,108436876.3,Other,ok
827,108436893.4,Other,ok
827,108436893.4,Other,then u are completely complacent
827,108436893.6,Other,[in a positive way]
827,108436896.1,Other,with your situation?
827,108436968.7,Edgwired,"if life changed little for the foreseeable future, then i can be quite satisfied with it, which isn't to say that if it changed quite a lot, i wouldn't be satisfied it"
827,108436991.9,Edgwired,i lead a good life
827,108436996.6,Other,yes
827,108436998.1,Edgwired,that's all i'm saying
827,108437035.7,Other,well
827,108437038.3,Other,I am saying
827,108437044.4,Other,u are a great person
827,108437054.2,Other,and u deserve to fashion your world as u see it
827,108437059.7,Other,but I think its impossible
827,108437061.6,Other,sometimes
827,108437064.8,Other,because u hide
827,108437073.7,Other,I think u are afraid sometimes
827,108437083.8,Other,to put your practice into your understanding
827,108437098.5,Edgwired,hiding doesn't change the experience one bit
827,108437103.6,Edgwired,it comes and finds me
827,108437108,Other,I dunno
827,108437112.1,Other,I disagree
827,108437120.1,Other,mebbe I am just being selfish
827,108437169.9,Edgwired,you and tedi and wes are a great example of how my inexpression of relationship manifested into the necessity to deal with every side of the issue at once
827,108437180.4,Other,be more concrete
827,108437181.4,Edgwired,and i don't necessarily prefer either experience
827,108437182.8,Other,I am tired
827,108437185.3,Other,no
827,108437195.2,Other,but those aren't YOUR relationships
827,108437205.5,Edgwired,nope
827,108437209,Other,see my frustration at your trepidation
827,108437218.4,Edgwired,i get to contextualize the issues without being emotionally attached
827,108437222.7,Edgwired,and yet
827,108437226.9,Edgwired,still face the same conclusions
827,108437237.3,Other,but mikee
827,108437243.2,Other,we are human beings
827,108437255.5,Other,u can't love and get hurt and gain strength
827,108437262,Other,vicariously
827,108437262,Other,all in all
827,108437268.8,Other,u can't hide in the garden forever
827,108437273.3,Other,and still complain
827,108437282,Edgwired,who is complaining?
827,108437282,Other,that u want more
827,108437285.3,Other,mmmm
827,108437286.9,Other,ok
827,108437303.2,Edgwired,this garden has open walls
827,108437309.9,Edgwired,it grows on its own
827,108437315.3,Other,ok
827,108437316.2,Edgwired,eventually everything may be included
827,108437322,Other,sure
827,108437326.3,Other,I think you're afraid
827,108437340.3,Other,sorry
827,108437347.6,Edgwired,i don't understand what you think i'm afraid of
827,108437368.5,Other,then forget it
827,108437388.1,Edgwired,"i have already done more, and seen more, and thought more, and created more than just about anyone i know"
827,108437402.1,Other,that's not the point
827,108437412.3,Other,I think you're afraid to go and get what u want
827,108437423.1,Other,and you're defensiveness proves it
827,108437455.6,Edgwired,i have more of what i want now than i have ever had
827,108437467.5,Edgwired,i get what i want
827,108437471.2,Edgwired,i'm not afraid to get it
827,108437471.3,Other,ok ok
827,108437477.7,Other,I disagree
827,108437501.7,Edgwired,my biggest fear
827,108437533.3,Edgwired,"is that at any point i already have everything i want, and won't acknowledge that to be true"
827,108437578.6,Edgwired,"but that is the fear that creates everything else, good and bad, and right now i'm willing to live with it"
827,108437602.1,Edgwired,"as far as going out and getting what i want, i have very little fear of creating experience"
827,108437611.9,Edgwired,i went to tn and got on a motorcycle
827,108437617.4,Edgwired,last best example
827,108437620.3,Edgwired,of me being motivated
827,108437621.8,Other,amazing of u
827,108437625.4,Other,I agree
827,108437634.8,Other,but what about your independence
827,108437636.9,Edgwired,"so, what of it that nothing else like that strikes my fancy"
827,108437646.8,Other,life is boring
827,108437652.4,Edgwired,life is simple
827,108437653.9,Edgwired,not boring
827,108437662.3,Edgwired,my life is definitely not boring
827,108437671.7,Edgwired,i could sit in my back yard and look at chipmunks
827,108437675.8,Other,ok
827,108437676.6,Edgwired,and i would be quite satisfied
827,108437680.4,Other,I disagree
827,108437684.7,Other,:F
827,108437696.1,Other,u want to smack me up side the head
827,108437699.8,Edgwired,no
827,108437706,Edgwired,i just don't think you're giving me a lot of credit
827,108437711,Other,OH MY
827,108437712.2,Other,NO
827,108437731.4,Other,I am only hard on u because I have been shown so many phenomenal things
827,108437737.8,Other,and I expect more...
827,108437739.3,Other,:P
827,108437769.8,Edgwired,"i get peace right now, and that's what i want"
827,108437793.3,Edgwired,i've fought enough wars to enjoy it
827,108437820.2,Other,I feel the same way
827,108437825.8,Other,and I am most happy for you
827,108437830.1,Other,but remember that

827,108437848,Other,"not without the good fight, lover"
827,108437854.2,Other,not without the good fight.

875,115855045.1,Other,all these djs on this forum should read this article
875,115855056.9,Other,this is totally right on:
875,115855091,Other,"astly, my best advice when looking for inspiration is to listen to your favorite pieces of music. Listen to the structure behind a piece and think about how you might write an algorithm to create that structure. Once you start writing the code you'll start to get more ideas based upon it, so that the eventual music sounds nothing like what you found inspiration from."
875,115855129.1,Edgwired,"yeah, just the idea of live coding is pretty crazy"
875,115855139.4,Edgwired,connected to music is really convergent

890,116990544.6,Edgwired,deciding which side of the fence you sit on is an immediate process and something that only the individual has perspective on
890,116990559.5,Edgwired,someone's negative is someone else's positive

899,118182301.6,Edgwired,it was a weird situation
899,118182311.6,Other,and I was suprised that Imri knew
899,118182316.4,Edgwired,ha
899,118182321.5,Edgwired,he knew that we hooked up?
899,118182330.3,Other,yup

899,118182341.1,Other,he said there was some freaky shit
899,118182345,Other,but he didn't care
899,118182350.7,Other,I was more surprised
899,118182362.5,Other,but you know I'm far from judgemental
899,118182366.5,Other,when it comes to you
899,118182380.6,Edgwired,i've been judging myself
899,118182383.6,Edgwired,well not really
899,118182384.6,Edgwired,but
899,118182392.5,Edgwired,i really rode it off the rails
899,118182393.5,Other,I just thought the girl was
899,118182398.3,Other,unactractive
899,118182400.3,Edgwired,ha
899,118182403.2,Edgwired,i know

899,118182407.3,Edgwired,in a way
899,118182409.8,Edgwired,not at all

899,118182414.1,Edgwired,her mind is amazing

899,118182440.6,Other,oh
899,118182449.6,Other,because if the answer was yes
899,118182456.9,Other,then the subject's over

899,118182492.5,Other,why?
899,118182498.8,Edgwired,because that's WAY over the line
899,118182501.3,Edgwired,that's like
899,118182503.6,Other,to you?
899,118182508.3,Edgwired,not something you want to do to your straight friends
899,118182516.5,Other,I don't think you should talk to me about that then...
899,118182518.6,Edgwired,because they shouldn't have to consider the possibility
899,118182526.7,Other,cause I never gave it a thought
899,118182536.4,Other,hey
899,118182540.7,Other,I smooched joey
899,118182543.9,Other,several times

899,118182670.7,Edgwired,until it overloads
899,118182674,Other,I feel like summer's been dead
899,118182675.7,Edgwired,and then in decline
899,118182697.2,Edgwired,i guess i missed the memo
899,118182703.3,Other,no
899,118182711.2,Other,it's purely internal
899,118182721.2,Other,but the solstice was on the 21st

899,118182819.8,Edgwired,i'm just grateful

899,118182840.3,Edgwired,HAAARRREEE

899,118182901.4,Other,mikee
899,118182906.9,Other,I am really confused
899,118182914.1,Edgwired,over?
899,118182926.7,Other,my mind is crazy
899,118182941.1,Other,as soon as I told joey I couldn't see him anymore
899,118182947.8,Other,I missd him more than ever
899,118182954.2,Edgwired,that's not out of the ordinary
899,118182959.4,Other,and I was a total bitch to wes
899,118182968.1,Edgwired,you want to know my opinion?
899,118182972.9,Other,go ahead
899,118182978.5,Other,if you have the enrgy
899,118183032.4,Edgwired,"i think either he and/or you is making a mistake by trying to avoid each other. no matter what the dynamic, you're surpressing energy that's everntually going to manifest itself one way or the other"
899,118183098.1,Other,so fuck it
899,118183103,Other,and just let it go
899,118183141.3,Edgwired,"yeah, i think trying to do it any other way is useless torture"
899,118183152.4,Other,but cheating on wes?
899,118183156.4,Other,that can't happen
899,118183159.2,Edgwired,ok
899,118183172.5,Edgwired,there are several many ways to see that it doesn't
899,118183196.9,Edgwired,and i think the option you each want to choose out of the best of intentions is the most difficult one to maintain
899,118183212.6,Other,I agree
899,118183220.8,Other,but discipline brings better reward
899,118183227.2,Other,we reap what we sow
899,118183256,Edgwired,"as long as you're not cutting yourself off from all the options, that's true"
899,118183301.6,Edgwired,"i think if you were more willing to consider the possibility that wes and joey could operate in different roles in your life, you'd be less drawn to changing the roles they have now"
899,118183317.4,Other,hmm
899,118183323.3,Other,explain that more conretely
899,118183326,Other,please
899,118183338.7,Edgwired,you remove the temptation by accepting its consequence
899,118183346.1,Edgwired,and then
899,118183353.5,Edgwired,energy flows
899,118183358.3,Edgwired,without the blockage
899,118183363.7,Edgwired,dangerous advice
899,118183373.5,Edgwired,because you're surrendering in a way
899,118183391.8,Edgwired,putting it up to faith
899,118183396.5,Edgwired,"if wes, then wes"
899,118183399.9,Edgwired,"if joey, then joey"
899,118183411,Other,wow
899,118183412.5,Other,ok
899,118183414.4,Edgwired,"if wes, not joey is what's holding you"
899,118183435.2,Other,but what if I'm just flowing to joey because he gives me the attention i like
899,118183442.8,Edgwired,totally possible
899,118183455.1,Edgwired,and i think it's a pretty valid observation
899,118183465.2,Edgwired,"does not matter though, does it?"
899,118183479.5,Other,nope
899,118183489,Other,I just don't want to be overly selfish
899,118183494.3,Other,all motives are selfish
899,118183503.2,Edgwired,i don't think you can avoid it
899,118183503.5,Other,but I don't want to fuck with someone
899,118183507,Edgwired,well
899,118183513,Edgwired,that's the only thing you have control over
899,118183517.3,Other,myself
899,118183519.8,Other,I know
899,118183523.9,Other,but I don't
899,118183527.1,Other,I kissed him
899,118183533.8,Other,and I don't twant to lead him one
899,118183552.9,Other,on
899,118183553.4,Edgwired,i think you're afraid of losing what you have
899,118183558.4,Other,yes!
899,118183564.9,Other,of course i am
899,118183599.6,Edgwired,"worst case scenerio: wes finds out, joey doesn't enter into a new relationship"
899,118183613.1,Other,that's not the worst case at all
899,118183621.6,Other,I don't want a new relationship
899,118183632,Edgwired,i wonder if that's honest
899,118183635.4,Other,it is
899,118183653.9,Edgwired,ok
899,118183654.3,Other,i just want to have fun with whomever I'm with
899,118183657.3,Edgwired,that may be honest
899,118183660.6,Other,no more taking to the family
899,118183669.5,Other,no more visting the family
899,118183677,Other,no more sleeping over all the time
899,118183683.4,Edgwired,but here's the deal:
899,118183688,Other,?
899,118183703.4,Edgwired,"if you're not willing to accept having two relationships, then wes needs to know about joey"
899,118183708.4,Other,he does
899,118183714.2,Other,I told him yesterday
899,118183718.5,Other,no Monday
899,118183722.2,Other,no yesterday
899,118183724.5,Other,sorry
899,118183726.6,Edgwired,heh
899,118183730.5,Edgwired,:F
899,118183732.3,Edgwired,good
899,118183738,Edgwired,the hard part is over
899,118183742.3,Other,u know I couldn't do tha
899,118183743.4,Other,t
899,118183751.4,Other,I mean he doesn't know all of my feelings
899,118183756.6,Other,but he knows I am tempted
899,118183763.6,Other,and he knows I kissed Joey
899,118183775.8,Other,but he tried to convince me it was out of sympathy
899,118183784.4,Other,and I disagreed
899,118183788.2,Edgwired,tried to convince himself
899,118183794.7,Other,maybe
899,118183802,Other,he doesn't seem scared to lose me
899,118183802.9,Other,...
899,118183810.6,Edgwired,i don't think he should be
899,118183836.6,Edgwired,"if you're scared of losing someone, you obviously aren't secure in the relatlonship"
899,118183875.7,Other,i dunno
899,118183881.2,Other,i think if you aren't afraid
899,118183892.8,Other,then you aren't into it
899,118183898.6,Edgwired,also a possibility
899,118183898.9,Other,I mean I agree with you
899,118183909.2,Other,but I think your assumption is too idealisitc
899,118183938.4,Edgwired,it's the best possible understanding
899,118183947.3,Edgwired,but it's like how i feel about my grandparents
899,118183955.5,Edgwired,i mean to say
899,118183957.1,Edgwired,it's possible
899,118184058.4,Edgwired,"fear is going to be part of any normal relationship, but if you ever found someone where the fear went away, that's the person you should marry"
899,118184059.7,Other,it is
899,118184067.8,Other,hmmm
899,118184071.6,Other,I trust wes a lot
899,118184075.7,Other,i do love wes
899,118184083.7,Other,I just need him to get a job
899,118184089,Other,and get the fuck out of my hair
899,118184096.4,Other,and not just come here when he needs something
899,118184104.6,Edgwired,i'm sure you love wes
899,118184141.5,Other,and I think the attraction with Joey is because shit is hard with wes right now
899,118184149.4,Other,may mostly be it
899,118184160.7,Other,not that joey is really better
899,118184162.5,Other,besides
899,118184174.4,Other,I had someone who was JUST like me
899,118184180,Other,and we fought the same fight
899,118184183.6,Other,all the time
899,118184190.9,Other,wes has taught me not to be so afraid
899,118184197.1,Other,when we fight and wes walks away
899,118184200.7,Other,i used to bugg out
899,118184209.2,Other,but now I trust that if he loves me
899,118184212.2,Other,he'll come back
899,118184220.4,Other,or if he doesn't
899,118184223.3,Other,I'm better off
899,118184233.6,Other,I was always holding tedi in a fight
899,118184239,Other,just to keep him around
899,118184243.9,Other,i don't need that with wes
899,118184253.9,Other,he helps me maintain my independence
899,118184265,Other,i've never wanted to be alone more
899,118184270.9,Other,since i met wes
899,118184273.4,Other,besides
899,118184279,Other,I don't find joey sexy
899,118184292,Other,i just like that he is slightly obsessed with me
899,118184295.8,Edgwired,ha
899,118184303.1,Edgwired,i think some of that is rationalization
899,118184311.7,Edgwired,"in that absence of wes, you would still enjoy joey"
899,118184318.4,Other,yes
899,118184318.7,Edgwired,you didn't think wes was attractive either
899,118184323.2,Other,hmmm
899,118184324.8,Other,right
899,118184327.1,Other,well
899,118184332.3,Other,I see what you mean
899,118184337.3,Other,sigh
899,118184339.5,Other,i dunno
899,118184347.7,Edgwired,you came to a great conclusion
899,118184365.3,Other,whassat
899,118184366.9,Edgwired,i think you're learning from the experience and i think you learned quickly
899,118184373.4,Edgwired,i think you're not done learning
899,118184378,Other,from wes
899,118184382.6,Other,or from joey
899,118184386.6,Other,or from both
899,118184387.7,Edgwired,same issue
899,118184391,Other,hmm
899,118184392.5,Other,k
899,118184396.7,Edgwired,eh
899,118184399.1,Edgwired,strike that
899,118184400.3,Other,we'll see where it goes
899,118184401.7,Edgwired,new issue
899,118184414.9,Edgwired,what you said just now was an old issue
899,118184423.2,Other,huh?
899,118184425.4,Other,:-/
899,118184428.8,Other,whachumean?
899,118184447.7,Edgwired,"the tedi/wes comparison, as opposed to the wes/joey comparison"
899,118184466.5,Edgwired,"one is recently gained knowledge, the other is a new question"
899,118184473.3,Other,right
899,118184475.4,Edgwired,not the only comparisons to be made
899,118184486.9,Edgwired,but logically seperate
899,118184521.4,Other,ahh
899,118184524.4,Other,I see
899,118184535.5,Other,I think joey is like tedi
899,118184540.6,Other,he makes me miss tedi a lot
899,118184543.2,Other,A LOT
899,118184547.8,Other,he is a more mature tedi
899,118184552.2,Edgwired,maybe so
899,118184553.9,Edgwired,although
899,118184570.8,Edgwired,"you've just concluded that you are not the same person that you were with tedi, nor is joey like the tedi that you were with"
899,118184578.9,Other,right
899,118184589,Other,and joey does certain things that I always said I wanted in a man
899,118184594.9,Other,he came after me
899,118184601.2,Other,he waits for me
899,118184608.6,Other,and he had the balls to say the other night
899,118184617,Other,I understand why you're doing this
899,118184618.7,Other,but
899,118184624.8,Other,I just think I'm better for you
899,118184645.1,Edgwired,you defintely deserve that kind of attention
899,118184650.8,Other,spanks
899,118184655.1,Other,he's also a Libra
899,118184661.9,Other,my astrological match
899,118184671.2,Other,but that's corny
899,118184673.9,Edgwired,ga
899,118184675.2,Edgwired,ja
899,118184692.8,Edgwired,"i'm not saying it's ""better"" attention than wes can give you"
899,118184697.4,Edgwired,but it's good attention
899,118184727.3,Other,right
899,118184730.8,Other,but you give me that
899,118184734.6,Other,and you are my friend
899,118184738.1,Other,maybe
899,118184744.8,Other,joey's just meant to be my friend
899,118184756,Edgwired,that's false hope
899,118184762.5,Other,oh?

974,103937223.2,Other,lol
974,103937225.8,Edgwired,a reasonable person
974,103937234.8,Other,let me guess u dont like bush
974,103937293.7,Edgwired,I respect that George Bush believes what he says.
974,103937303.5,Edgwired,However.
974,103937309.5,Edgwired,fill in the argument
974,103937312,Edgwired,...
974,103937343,Other,i dont know what ur thinkin
974,103937363.2,Edgwired,you could pretty much pick an issue
974,103937374.2,Edgwired,"he's like, the anti-me"
974,103937381.9,Edgwired,better yet
974,103937387.4,Edgwired,Dick Cheney is the anti-me
974,103937390.9,Other,i wouldnt say anti u - or me -
974,103937394.2,Other,why anti u
974,103937412.4,Edgwired,i don't lie to people on a regular basis
974,103937436,Other,i dont think the pres does either
974,103937457,Other,as a matter of a fact - as he stated in his press conf - the one thing u can count on - is when he says something he will do it
974,103937490,Edgwired,"he doesn't have the ability to consider alternate points of view, and that makes him a bad manageer"
974,103937514.1,Other,no i would say he is a very good manager -
974,103937527,Other,because he enables his ppl around him - and trust what they say
974,103937573,Edgwired,the people around him advise him with biased information
974,103937591.2,Other,TRUE
974,103937599.1,Other,because it is impossible not to be bias
974,103937601.5,Other,on any issue
974,103937620.7,Other,the ppl around him - have a like minded agenda - its the agenda of the ppl who put him office
974,103937672,Edgwired,i disagree. presenting something subjectively doesn't go as far as omitting critical information in order to sell a point
974,103937682.5,Edgwired,that's bad business
974,103937693.5,Other,and r u refering to iraq
974,103937696.5,Edgwired,no
974,103937698.4,Edgwired,not just
974,103937699.3,Other,then what
974,103937707.4,Edgwired,the perscription drug benefit
974,103937708.6,Edgwired,the epa
974,103937711.8,Edgwired,and on
974,103937712.7,Edgwired,and on
974,103937737.2,Other,what about the benifis
974,103937777.3,Edgwired,a week after it was passed we found out the administration supressed the true cost from the congress
974,103937794.5,Other,see my issue is this - they say he didnt do a good job with the econ - now they are seeing that the bush tax cuts worked
974,103937822.3,Other,they say he did nothing with persecipt drugs for elders - no its not the best -but its a start and better then what they had
974,103937847.1,Edgwired,it's also going to cost one hundred fifty Billion more than they were willing to admit to
974,103937863.9,Edgwired,No Child Left Behind is a regular disaster
974,103937885.1,Edgwired,and
974,103937890,Edgwired,the piece de resistence
974,103937897,Edgwired,an Amendment
974,103937899.2,Edgwired,against
974,103937901.1,Edgwired,people like me
974,103937910.2,Other,now this is where u will not like me
974,103937912.4,Edgwired,building discrimination back into our constitution
974,103937930.9,Other,because - i think the pres is right on that issue
974,103937934.7,Other,he had no other choice
974,103937956.8,Other,when liberal courts decide to make laws - then elected officials - have no other recourse
974,103937985.6,Other,i thnk that marriage is defined as that of a man and woman - i do support civil unions - but when u go and redefine marriage thats an issue
974,103938016.4,Edgwired,marriage is a legal contract that falls under the rights of equal protection
974,103938023.6,Edgwired,no judge made any law
974,103938040.2,Other,marriage lic is a legal act
974,103938051.7,Other,but marriage as it is defined - is that of a man and woman
974,103938069.5,Edgwired,the legal definition is the only one the counts
974,103938087.2,Edgwired,moral definitions are contrary to founding principles
974,103938104.6,Other,but they are what the ppl know
974,103938109.5,Other,and they are what the ppl want
974,103938115.1,Edgwired,not what i want
974,103938143.1,Other,tell me why a civil union will not work for u
974,103938144.9,Edgwired,legislating morality is tyrrany
974,103938174.3,Other,ignoring it is detrimental to society
974,103938187.7,Edgwired,the romans did quite well for themselves
974,103938205.7,Other,so what made rome fall
974,103938238.8,Edgwired,"given enough time, everything changes"
974,103938252,Other,lets hope not
974,103938274.6,Edgwired,change is the only constant
974,103938281.3,Edgwired,that's physics
974,103938308.7,Other,true - but maybe we need to change back some things
974,103938343,Edgwired,"well as long as we're revoking civil rights, there are a few i think you might want reconsider"
974,103938356.9,Other,what civil rights are we revoking
974,103938388.8,Other,"the stuggle i have is - how do u compare ones sexuality which is a personal and private issue with that of blacks, woman and other minorities - its not the same"
974,103938400.9,Edgwired,it most certainly is
974,103938410.6,Other,no it is not
974,103938416,Other,explain how
974,103938416.9,Edgwired,homosexuality isn't a choice
974,103938423.8,Edgwired,or at least
974,103938428.5,Other,see and that is where we differ
974,103938431.2,Other,i think it is
974,103938456.2,Edgwired,made before we can be held responsible for it
974,103938467.9,Other,explain
974,103938487.9,Edgwired,most people know they're gay before they hit puberty
974,103938511.8,Other,but what about those who dont?
974,103938522.1,Other,do they make a choice
974,103938538,Edgwired,i don't think you can call instinct a choice
974,103938543.3,Edgwired,and i dont think you can outlaw instinct
974,103938560.2,Edgwired,and i think instinct is just as basic as sex
974,103938565.2,Edgwired,or race
974,103938573.9,Other,i would disagree
974,103938606.8,Other,and see thats the difference - ur taking something that is not tangable and using it against a tanagble item and trying to make an argument with it
974,103938619,Other,now - so that u understand
974,103938625.4,Other,I am fine with my sexuality -
974,103938644.1,Other,its not something that i hide - but at the same time - it is not something i flaunt either
974,103938665.1,Other,the greatest form of acceptance for me - is when someone tells me they dont care
974,103938695.7,Other,because - the same way i dont want to know what my girlfriend and her bf are are doing in bed - is the same way i dont want to know who my gay friends are sleeping with
974,103938738,Edgwired,how can you translate the choice of ignorance into a constitutional amendment?
974,103938771.3,Other,it is not a choice of ignorance
974,103938784.1,Edgwired,"i don't want to know"
974,103938811.5,Other,i understand there are legal reason why a gay couple would want the legal benifits of a married couple
974,103938822.5,Other,"insurance, etc"
974,103938828.8,Other,i support that
974,103938832.6,Edgwired,and you can't accept that they want to make the same level of commitment>?
974,103938839.5,Edgwired,under their own beliefs
974,103938840.5,Edgwired,?
974,103938852.5,Edgwired,under a perfectly acceptable belief system?
974,103938855.1,Other,but isnt that pushing their believe system on everyone else
974,103938858.7,Edgwired,no
974,103938868.7,Edgwired,because their marriage doesn't affect your beliefs
974,103938873.6,Other,but its not an acceptable belief system to everyone
974,103938876.1,Edgwired,how are you harmed by gay marriage?
974,103938891.7,Other,it does when it opens the door for any other type of act
974,103938902.1,Edgwired,because of course
974,103938907.5,Edgwired,all homosexuals are pedophiles
974,103938916.3,Other,no not at all
974,103938921.2,Edgwired,that's the implication
974,103938923,Other,remember u r talkin to one
974,103938958.6,Edgwired,my lifestyle doesnt' open the door to bad things
974,103938964.7,Edgwired,for other people
974,103938971.6,Other,ur lifestyle no
974,103938983.5,Other,but this act of gay marriage does
974,103939036.6,Other,what to say that a person says hey - if 2 guys can get married - then i want a 2nd wife - or even stranger i want to marry my goat - as crazy as it sounds - thats what can happen - and thats what ppl are afraid of
974,103939053.6,Edgwired,why do you care
974,103939059.4,Edgwired,what other people choose to do with their lives
974,103939064.3,Edgwired,you just said you don't want to know about it
974,103939081.9,Edgwired,how would you feel
974,103939085.5,Other,its a morality issue
974,103939088,Edgwired,if someone started caring about things you do
974,103939096.9,Edgwired,and prevented you from doing them
974,103939108.1,Other,and morality affects society lol
974,103939113.2,Edgwired,what's the difference between you and the worse redneck?
974,103939132.5,Other,i am blk
974,103939143.4,Edgwired,that's a coincidence
974,103939151,Other,but prob not much more then that - in ur thinkin
974,103939151.7,Edgwired,and a convenience
974,103939174.3,Other,how so
974,103939188.1,Edgwired,your argument is no different than Jerry Falwell's. it's just blunted.
974,103939206,Other,i have issues with Jerry
974,103939220.5,Other,but my issues with Jerry are a lil different
974,103939220.6,Edgwired,then i'm surprised you forward his ideals
974,103939230.2,Other,its not his ideals
974,103939252.9,Other,now grant u - i am prob the biggest oxymoron in the world
974,103939269.6,Edgwired,that's not a justification
974,103939282.2,Other,no but it does affect my thinkin and choices
974,103939339,Other,"see i am was raised one of those conservative right wing christians, went to Christian school - college - hell i even had a full ride to Jerry's school -"
974,103939350.7,Other,I understand the thought pattern of them
974,103939364.6,Other,for the most part - outside of me being gay - i am one
974,103939399.9,Other,and i struggled
974,103939400.9,Edgwired,and you were able to reconcile your sexuality with that moral code?
974,103939414.1,Edgwired,because the only way to do that is develop your own belief system
974,103939416.1,Other,its hard - trust me it is truly difficult
974,103939424.5,Edgwired,which every individual
974,103939429.2,Edgwired,at least in this society
974,103939431.3,Edgwired,has a right to do
974,103939437.6,Edgwired,that supercedes every other right
974,103939438.9,Other,nah - my believe system is still intact i would say
974,103939446.7,Edgwired,but it's your own
974,103939449.5,Edgwired,it isn't the party line
974,103939455.3,Other,no not at all
974,103939458,Edgwired,it isn't what's in the book
974,103939468.7,Edgwired,you've made up your own exceptions to the rule
974,103939474.4,Other,see - my issue with Christians today in regards to homosexual is simple
974,103939482.8,Other,no i made no exception to the rule
974,103939493,Other,if asked - i tell my christian friends and anyone
974,103939495.8,Edgwired,then you must hate yourself
974,103939520.7,Other,i make a conscience decision to do something that i know is wrong - and i dont have myself for it
974,103939539.4,Edgwired,you would be willing to be thrown in jail if you were caught?
974,103939613.8,Other,"but see Christians - they can forgive ever other type of sinner, from a murder, to a child molester, a thief - but we alienate the homosexual and wonder why they dont want to have anything to do with us - and its a fear issue - caus the reality of it is in the Chruch in great numbers"
974,103939664.2,Other,and for my believes - i think i can say i would be willing to be thrown in jail yes
974,103939680.3,Other,see its a lot easier to say something - and more difficult to act on it
974,103939715.7,Edgwired,and you've accepted the dictate that according to your own beliefs you're going to burn in a Christian hell?
974,103939771.1,Other,well according to my Christian believe system I dont burn in hell for my sins - i burn in hell for rejecting Christ
974,103939799.7,Edgwired,according to Paul you reject Christ with your sins
974,103939863.8,Other,see the great think about Christ and Christianity is - every other religion is based on what u do - but Christianity is based on what Christ did - and once u accept Christ - there is nothing u can do to lose it - its there for good
974,103939883.7,Edgwired,i hope that works out for you
974,103939914.6,Other,"it does - and see the good thing is - i knew that before i started acting on my homosexual ""instint"
974,103939942.8,Edgwired,yours is only one interpretation of Christianity among Christians
974,103939957.9,Edgwired,many of them don't agree with you
974,103939966.6,Other,and i would argue to them
974,103939974.1,Other,prove it in the bible
974,103939984.9,Edgwired,the bible is full of contradictions
974,103939989.5,Other,lol
974,103939991.4,Edgwired,and things we find morally reprehensible
974,103940014.9,Other,u may think - but to a christian - it is the basic of life - and everything one needs for life is in it
974,103940036.5,Other,so if they argue Christianity any other way then mine - they better be able to back it up - thats all i am saying
974,103940107.3,Edgwired,what if a Christian put to you the Bible's interpretation of a womans place?
974,103940139,Other,explain
974,103940154.6,Other,u mean to be submissive
974,103940159.7,Edgwired,not just
974,103940184.1,Edgwired,women deserved to be stoned when they disobey?
974,103940229.5,Other,under the law
974,103940250.9,Other,"old testament - under law new testament - under grace"
974,103940386.5,Other,wow - i didnt think i would end up on this conversation
974,103940405.7,Edgwired,these are the only ones that matter to me
974,103940452.4,Other,good to know
974,103940469.4,Other,i prob didnt score many points with u then :-)
974,103940485.8,Edgwired,"eh, you have the strength of conviction"
974,103940491,Edgwired,which is respectable
974,103940506.8,Edgwired,but the logical ends of your arguments are places i don't go
974,103940507.3,Other,thank u
974,103940571.8,Other,u know i tend not to bring up my religious opinion esp when i am talkin to gays - i try to keep it to myself for that very reason - and others
974,103940659.3,Edgwired,i don't talk about religion or politics
974,103940673.1,Edgwired,as anything but intellectual exercises
974,103940697.8,Other,well i think politics esp this election will be a major decididng factor in our nation
974,103940819.7,Edgwired,i would consider leaving if we continue with the current policy
974,103940832.4,Other,really
974,103940837.2,Edgwired,yes
974,103940839.4,Other,why is that
974,103940976.7,Edgwired,it's depressing to watch malice spread
974,103940999.6,Other,explain
974,103941113.4,Edgwired,i don't enjoy judgemental people or policies made at the expense of of others
974,103941144.6,Other,every policy is made at the expense of others
974,103941186.7,Edgwired,"if you believe that, then you have less understanding of creativity than i expected"
974,103941215.4,Other,no no
974,103941229.5,Other,i am very creative and understanding - but the bottom line is that is true
974,103941252.6,Other,name any policy - and someone is not happy with it
974,103941316.8,Edgwired,"not everyone has to be happy, they just deserve to be considered."
974,103941328.5,Other,agreed
974,103941339.5,Other,i couldnt agree with u more
974,103941470.6,Edgwired,"not prejudicially considered, but actually listened to"
974,103941509.2,Other,i agree
974,103941512.9,Other,but that means all side
974,103941605.9,Other,I dont mind those who disagree with me - i think thats a good thing - and provide balance - and I dont always have to win - as long as the decisions that is reached is the best one for everyone - its all about balance -
974,103941639.1,Edgwired,i think it's pretty fair to say that the past four years have given us legislation that isn't in the best interests of everyone
974,103941644.9,Edgwired,haven't
974,103941667.2,Other,i wouldnt say that at all
974,103941709.8,Edgwired,ok
974,103941710.7,Edgwired,enough
974,103941716.6,Other,ok how bout this

977,100474305.8,Other,he got an attitude with me
977,100474311.7,Other,which I did not appreciate
977,100474334.3,Edgwired,over?
977,100474345,Other,the location of the copy machines
977,100474349.8,Edgwired,figures

1013,116208935.1,Edgwired,it would make it easier to hunt
1013,116208944.9,Other,yeah
1013,116208962.6,Edgwired,although
1013,116208968.8,Edgwired,most gay dudes i don't like

1013,116209047.4,Other,I dont click with many of them
1013,116209062.3,Other,and most of gay guys are VERY superficial and vain
1013,116209067.1,Other,and thats just to sad
1013,116209092.9,Edgwired,"i'm pretty vain, but i'm not superficial"

1013,116209349.4,Edgwired,actually
1013,116209366.9,Edgwired,i wonder if it's vanity if you only care about your own opinion and no one elses
1013,116209369.9,Edgwired,probably
1013,116209374.4,Edgwired,even more so
1013,116209377,Other,all I can say is whatever makes you happy for for it
1013,116209385.5,Edgwired,looking good makes me happy

1013,116209494.4,Edgwired,i haven't run across a gay boy who agrees
1013,116209572.5,Other,maybe they find you intimidating?
1013,116209584.6,Edgwired,that's pretty par for the course
1013,116209589.6,Other,or maybe you just have a look that you dont want anything serious?
1013,116209591.3,Edgwired,but frustrating and stupid
1013,116209596.2,Edgwired,nah

1013,116209923.9,Edgwired,i find it difficult to keep sex interesting after a while
1013,116209928.8,Edgwired,unless you're willing to really play like kids
1013,116209940,Other,actually
1013,116209946.5,Other,the 4 year one
1013,116209950.4,Other,was never boring
1013,116209959.8,Other,we liked to spice it up
1013,116209962.4,Other,in the bedroom
1013,116209965.2,Other,so always hot times
1013,116209970.9,Edgwired,in what ways?
1013,116209993.3,Other,oh you name it
1013,116209999.4,Other,he was kinda on the dominant side
1013,116210006.2,Other,so it would get wild
1013,116210027.2,Edgwired,good for you
1013,116210036,Edgwired,i like to switch it up a lot
1013,116210053.4,Other,in what way?
1013,116210075.2,Edgwired,"toys, slings, props, you name it"
1013,116210080.4,Edgwired,the only thing i think i'm over
1013,116210084.5,Edgwired,as far as relationships are concerned
1013,116210087.4,Edgwired,are groups
1013,116210092.1,Edgwired,i'm too much of a jealous bastard
1013,116210093.5,Edgwired,i guess
1013,116210097.5,Other,lol
1013,116210102.5,Other,I never did groups
1013,116210109.7,Other,I am very jelous type
1013,116210115.2,Edgwired,much better when you're single IMO
1013,116210117.5,Other,I would kick their ass if they touch my man
1013,116210160.3,Edgwired,yeah
1013,116210172.2,Edgwired,my last bf insisted on threesomes
1013,116210182.1,Edgwired,because that was how he like to keep sex interesting
1013,116210182.8,Edgwired,but
1013,116210190,Edgwired,waking up to him with someone else
1013,116210192.8,Edgwired,was too much
1013,116210197.2,Edgwired,i went postal
1013,116210216.4,Other,sorry man
1013,116210223.7,Other,I could NEVER do that
1013,116210265,Other,to me if a guy asks for a 3some it only shows that he is no longer interested in me
1013,116210280.6,Other,that I dont do anything for him anymore
1013,116210285,Edgwired,"yeah, it was a pretty loose thing anyway i guess, in retrospect"
1013,116210296.2,Edgwired,i got kicked out of my house with him
1013,116210300.9,Other,I dated this one guy for like 3 weeks
1013,116210301.1,Edgwired,so we were sticking together for a while
1013,116210311.7,Other,on a 3rd week
1013,116210318,Other,he asked if we could have a 3some
1013,116210321.8,Other,I was like bye bye
1013,116210392.4,Edgwired,yeah
1013,116210402.3,Edgwired,i think i'd really love it if someone were that protective over me
1013,116210411,Edgwired,but it hasn't happened yet
1013,116210425,Other,well I dont know
1013,116210430.7,Other,my X didnt like that
1013,116210440.2,Other,"he thought I didnt ""trust him"
1013,116210466.8,Other,cause I am very very protective of my man
1013,116210517.5,Edgwired,hmmm
1013,116210522.4,Edgwired,to what extent?
1013,116210608.2,Other,but he loved the fact I would get jelous if someone tried to hit on him
1013,116210615.6,Other,he actually did it on porpuse
1013,116210622.9,Other,to see me get all edgy
1013,116210626.3,Other,that bitch

1013,116210631.8,Edgwired,i'd have to say
1013,116210635.7,Edgwired,it would be sexy in a way
1013,116210641,Edgwired,i think it would turn me on
1013,116210643,Edgwired,but then again
1013,116210647.1,Other,then he would come to me and kiss me infront of everyone and call me silly
1013,116210649.4,Edgwired,i'd hate to be accused of something i didn't do
1013,116210682.5,Other,nah he was cool
1013,116210694.9,Other,he would tell whoever came up to him straight up that he is with me
1013,116210705.7,Other,but of course some fags cant take no for an answer
1013,116210737.7,Edgwired,heh

1091,118558551.2,Edgwired,i was on the corner of the waterbed
1091,118558567.7,Edgwired,bent over backwards and gripping the wall for all it was worth
1091,118558581.8,Edgwired,i have a nice mark on my back for my trouble

1091,118558702.8,Other,i thought u were getting a massage
1091,118558708.5,Edgwired,post massage
1091,118558713.1,Edgwired,i skipped over that part

1091,118558732.6,Edgwired,i started on top
1091,118558764.8,Edgwired,"incidentally, what type of guy do you think i would be seen with?"
1091,118558792,Other,"well, granted you don't have a great body. you're skinny...at least that what it appears in your pics. so that lowers your standards"
1091,118558807.4,Edgwired,ha
1091,118558829.9,Other,just not a gay bar bartender
1091,118558853.5,Edgwired,that's pretty funny
1091,118558880.9,Edgwired,the boys i'm with are very well put together
1091,118558932.3,Edgwired,http://neocyde.net/art/smallwonder.html
1091,118558934.8,Edgwired,first boyfriend

1091,118558968.6,Other,omg...gross
1091,118558973.6,Other,way not what i expected
1091,118558991.4,Other,i think it has to do with the colors
1091,118558997.9,Other,"but still, not what i expected"
1091,118559004.1,Other,i thought more along preppy lines
1091,118559016.7,Edgwired,i was a party kid
1091,118559019.8,Edgwired,when i dated them
1091,118559031.5,Other,then you're contridicting yourself
1091,118559036.7,Edgwired,how is that?
1091,118559045.4,Other,well put together VS party kids
1091,118559064.4,Other,not establishing a clear case with me ;)
1091,118559074.6,Other,but i just enjoy giving you a HARD time
1091,118559078.6,Edgwired,i don't see why those things are mutually exclusive
1091,118559079.8,Edgwired,however
1091,118559088.2,Edgwired,i see the point you're making
1091,118559089.7,Edgwired,and
1091,118559103.7,Edgwired,i can only say that we're talking about a span of about five years
1091,118559134.2,Other,it's ok...not everyone is as perfect as i am
1091,118559143.4,Other,nor do i expect them to live up to my standards
1091,118559158.6,Other,O:-)
1091,118559172.9,Other,<--- ugly on the inside and out
1091,118559202,Edgwired,"when i was your age, i looked like this: http://neocyde.net/built.jpg"
1091,118559217.8,Edgwired,now i look like this: http://neocyde.net/bathtime2.jpg
1091,118559218.6,Other,good to make improvements
1091,118559224.5,Other,i know...i have the 2nd one saved
1091,118559228.3,Edgwired,that pretty much sums it up
1091,118559243.6,Other,i'm curious and doubtful you look as hot as your 2nd pic in real life
1091,118559264,Other,i think u lucked up and took an amazing pic
1091,118559272.5,Edgwired,it's possible
1091,118559275.9,Edgwired,most people don't think so
1091,118559290.2,Edgwired,i get an excellent response when i'm out
1091,118559296.1,Other,as do i
1091,118559301.6,Other,but i'm really not that attractive
1091,118559303.6,Other,;)
1091,118559357.6,Edgwired,"after a certain point, hot boys are just hot boys. i've been with enough to know they're interchangable"
1091,118559412.6,Other,the thing is that i'm not just hot...i have the entire package...and most people throw themselves at me for one reason or another
1091,118559429.6,Other,which i'm sure you'll do
1091,118559456.4,Edgwired,"actually, i think you'll be more attractive in about 5 years, when you're secure enough in it to not need to acknowledge it"
1091,118559500.7,Other,hahaha...i'm really not as cocky about it as i appear on here. you're just chatting with me after i've been ripping apart a whartonite tonight
1091,118559505.6,Other,it's a game for me
1091,118559511.1,Other,but that's another story
1091,118559524.7,Other,"at last, i am sleepy!!!"
1091,118559525.6,Other,lol
1091,118559536.5,Other,please don't think i'm a cocky ass...i was just dick'n around
1091,118559550.9,Other,"i'm a very sweet guy, nothing all that special"
1091,118559568.8,Edgwired,"dr jekyll, meet mr hyde"
1091,118559583.5,Other,haha...which ones the real me?
1091,118559589.9,Edgwired,i suspect you're probably what you say
1091,118559590.3,Other,or am i still playing with your head
1091,118559596.2,Edgwired,however
1091,118559624.3,Edgwired,you're also on the far side of a lot of things i learned a long time ago
1091,118559649.6,Edgwired,it's easy to be a big fish
1091,118559676.8,Edgwired,however the point is to conceal your power until you truly need to call on it
1091,118559716.3,Edgwired,"people like us recognize each other for what we are, without having to put it on display"
1091,118559727.4,Edgwired,i met someone today in fact
1091,118559739.9,Edgwired,"if you're self-aware, you convey it nonverbally"
1091,118559976.6,Other,"we're online, nothing is ever verbal. but one lesson i have learned is don't pass judgments and attempt to analyze something online...online is just a giant fake force. i believe if you encountered me in real life, things would be much different."
1091,118559996.1,Edgwired,clearly
1091,118560001.1,Other,indeed
1091,118560005.2,Other,but i must sleep
1091,118560009.3,Edgwired,sleep well
1091,118560046.9,Other,"thank you for making me smile...i think under the horn dog that you appear to be online, you're more than a cute face...we'd probably get along quite well"
1091,118560059,Other,we'll have to conduct that experiment eventually
1091,118560069.3,Edgwired,at a date to be determined in the future
1091,118560089.1,Other,yeap...the king has left the building...peace out
1092,119076207.3,Edgwired,do you have plans for the friday before halloween?
1092,119076215.1,Other,i don't know

1092,119076326.1,Other,how many people?
1092,119076368.6,Edgwired,"no idea, last year it was invite only and we ended up with over a hundred"
1092,119076381.4,Edgwired,the house was packed to the gills
1092,119076386.7,Edgwired,and it's a *house*
1092,119076390.4,Other,"and of course you should realize if i'm coming, i must bring a friend or 2...for comfort"
1092,119076399,Edgwired,yes

1092,119076401.9,Other,cool

1092,119076617.3,Edgwired,it will most likely be a weekend long bender
1092,119076641.2,Other,yea
1092,119076647.3,Edgwired,if i had to take a guess i'd say Zete's at Penn
1092,119076706.1,Other,fun
1092,119076707.8,Other,i guess
1092,119076807.9,Edgwired,"years ago it was the best party of the year. now, i only know alumni, so i'm taking a wait and see attitude"
1092,119076889.4,Other,Henri David Ball is the big thing now
1092,119076892.3,Other,or it was last year
1092,119076897.4,Other,the wildest party
1092,119076917,Other,"and your ticket price goes towards AIDS research, i do believe"
1092,119076974.6,Edgwired,where is it held?

1093,119319397.8,Other,"how could you even recognize me? i went out looking like shit...didn't shave, didn't really do my hair, how the fuck would u know that was me?"
1093,119319409.1,Edgwired,i'm that good

1093,119319458.1,Other,doubtful...i saw 2 people i was attracted to...one being this asian kid dancing...and the other was the guy handing out beer with his shirt off

1093,119319484,Edgwired,i passed right in front of you on my cellphone

1093,119319659.1,Edgwired,i like being sneaky
1093,119319673,Other,ha...that's no fun
1093,119319679.1,Edgwired,it's lots of fun
1093,119319685.2,Edgwired,gathering intelligence
1093,119319705.1,Other,i don't see how you could even come close to knowing who i was based on my pics
1093,119319731.9,Edgwired,greenish shirt
1093,119319741.9,Edgwired,"standing with a girl with long, dark hair"
1093,119319771,Edgwired,at least that's what i remember

1093,119319843.4,Other,all my girls were getting hit on...it was so funny
1093,119319848.8,Other,"then again, they are all very pretty"
1093,119319857,Other,2 of them were forced onto the dance area for a while
1093,119319869.9,Other,me and julia grab on to each other and refused to dance b/c we weren't drunk
1093,119319895.4,Edgwired,i think that's what you were doing when i saw you
1093,119319902.9,Edgwired,i thought in this particular case
1093,119319910.1,Edgwired,the lesbians were much better dressed than the fags
1093,119319917.1,Edgwired,"which is out of the ordinary, or so says maria"
1093,119319925.4,Edgwired,i saw a couple girls that were smokin

1093,119319949.7,Edgwired,i was so fucking beat that day too
1093,119319960.4,Edgwired,but it's fun to get more people going

1093,119320357.4,Edgwired,anything that arbitrary isn't very useful
1093,119320381.2,Edgwired,"it's like astrology, or number theory"
1093,119320399.1,Other,i guess it's good to get a glance at the accounting world
1093,119320399.9,Other,lol
1093,119320406.7,Other,lets me know its not what i want to do
1093,119320436.7,Edgwired,"oddly enough, it's pretty much all i do when i'm involved in a business"
1093,119320470.5,Other,i'm more into the start up of businesses...i'm extremely visual and creative...so i get wild ideas all the time

1094,119487914.1,Other,"i do remember seeing you...you walked right in front of me heading towards the DJ booth...you were kinda tall, like 5'11""-6'00, on a phone, dark long hair, skinny...i remember seeing someone who looked like that."
1094,119488774.7,Edgwired,"almost. i'm 5'6"
1094,119488803.7,Other,oh...hmm...maybe my memory is distorted...but i do remember someone walking in front of me

1194,106803889.4,Other,china basiically raped india
1194,106803901.4,Other,and still holds large swathes of territory
1194,106803911,Edgwired,how much fun would it be to have 2 billion people at war
1194,106803917.2,Other,hehe
1194,106803930.4,Other,some quick population control
1194,106803938.2,Other,both nuclear powers

1194,106803980.2,Other,or else we could just have two billion folks running at each other
1194,106803992.6,Other,now THAT would be fun to watch
1194,106804022.9,Edgwired,you'd have to have a wide angle lens
1194,106804034,Other,yeah.. very wide
1194,106804038.5,Other,but doable
1194,106804096.2,Edgwired,i think we should model it first
1194,106804100.6,Edgwired,at a National lab
1194,106804106.7,Other,you think?
1194,106804118.9,Edgwired,so we can compare results
1194,106804133.1,Other,it'd just be a billion red dots and a billion green dots smashing into each other
1194,106804136.6,Other,not too exciting
1194,106804205.7,Edgwired,green dots and blue dots turning into red dots then black dots
1194,106804209.6,Edgwired,piles of dots
1194,106804225.5,Edgwired,i wonder if they would procreate?

1202,106102343.7,Other,misa makes my head hurt sometimes... now she's not coming until god only knows
1202,106102359.8,Other,like she's sooo unsure of things and it sucks
1202,106102380,Other,because on the other side of that sometimes she is sure
1202,106102391.9,Other,*bangs head against desk*
1202,106102394.9,Other,women...
1202,106102401.8,Other,*shakes head*
1202,106102412.2,Edgwired,deep breath
1202,106102471,Other,like she wants to move here with me but she doesn't want to move here for me... and I'm cool with that... but she doesn't think I understand and she freaks when I tell her I do
1202,106102507.8,Other,i know she's at a scary time but tht doesn't mean she has to do it alone...
1202,106102531.4,Other,but I can't convince her of that
1202,106102542.8,Other,it's kind of frustratiing..
1202,106102552.2,Other,i just want her here already...
1202,106102574.7,Edgwired,i'm thinking maybe it would be better if she did it on her own
1202,106102591.1,Other,me too... sort of.. now...
1202,106102612.2,Other,im just worries that she'll never get here...
1202,106102620.8,Other,and i'll be left...
1202,106102628,Other,right where I was before...
1202,106102642.9,Other,alone... and very confused.

1202,106102689.6,Other,i know
1202,106102692.2,Edgwired,otherwise you're co-dependent
1202,106102699.4,Other,but sometimes I think its going to work...
1202,106102703.5,Other,then... it does'
1202,106102704.4,Other,t
1202,106102739.2,Other,like right now I could be hanging out with maria... but Im not because I might have this life coming up with misa
1202,106102757.3,Other,so it's like im on hold for something that might not even happen
1202,106102787.1,Other,for once in my life im getting attention... I don't know who's to accept
1202,106102802.8,Other,being a monk fucking sucks!

1202,106102845.9,Other,it sucks

1202,106102919.9,Edgwired,you can be wholesome and enjoy it
1202,106102924.9,Edgwired,or you can be dirty and not care
1202,106102949.7,Edgwired,but doesn't have to use two good things to make bad

1202,106102998.4,Edgwired,and don't worry about what might be
1202,106103009.3,Other,but what if it bites me in the ass
1202,106103029.6,Other,"im scared, mike.. scared of ruining something I don't even know I have..."
1202,106103045.5,Other,but at the same time...
1202,106103056.9,Edgwired,much easier to say that you made the decisions knowing you were happy
1202,106103067.4,Other,i'm lonely..
1202,106103073,Edgwired,"and really, you can keep making decisions that way"
1202,106103082.2,Edgwired,they work themselves out
1202,106103089.3,Edgwired,at least in my experience
1202,106103090.6,Edgwired,so far
1202,106103111.5,Other,i guess I just don't want anyone to get hurt
1202,106103133,Other,but I... maybe I can't prevnt that for the rest of my life...

1205,110933112.2,Edgwired,i'm disappointed about not moving

1205,110933158.5,Other,how well would that work...?

1205,110933173.5,Edgwired,sometimes
1205,110933179.9,Edgwired,not going to be easy work
1205,110933182,Edgwired,but
1205,110933184.1,Edgwired,it's worthwhile

1205,110933364.3,Edgwired,haa
1205,110933374.7,Other,it makes the search harder
1205,110933395.5,Other,im going to look at a place on Friday at 22 & spruce.
1205,110933406,Edgwired,that's a great neighborhood
1205,110933419.7,Other,it's a basement apartment with a patio
1205,110933426.4,Other,so I don't know
1205,110933439.6,Other,but it's cheap and the area IS great
1205,110933449.8,Edgwired,definitely
1205,110933455.3,Edgwired,when i was looking for a single

1205,110933518.8,Other,i'm getting frustrated
1205,110933537.8,Other,but I have karma on my side... at least I hope I do.

1205,110933565.6,Edgwired,i'm sure it will work out
1205,110933569.4,Edgwired,you have options at least
1205,110933582.1,Other,some but few
1205,110933587.8,Other,it'll work out

1205,110933616.9,Edgwired,i didn't get a response from him
1205,110933620.9,Edgwired,but
1205,110933646.7,Other,so he knows... I was going to ask... but I decided I didn't want to hear him bitch
1205,110933648.5,Edgwired,i'm not worried about it really
1205,110933654.6,Edgwired,oh yeah
1205,110933655.1,Other,don't be
1205,110933655.7,Edgwired,i called
1205,110933659,Edgwired,and left a message
1205,110933662.7,Edgwired,and also sent a message
1205,110933668,Edgwired,they have a month to find someone
1205,110933673.6,Other,he'll just have to deal
1205,110933674.6,Edgwired,which with what they have should be easy
1205,110933683.6,Other,it will be
1205,110933719.9,Edgwired,"i regret that it didn't work out way ahead of time for them, but i'm also not sure i was set up with the best situation if i did more in"
1205,110933721.8,Edgwired,move in
1205,110933726.1,Other,he didn't believe I was moving for the first 6 times I told him was
1205,110933735.8,Edgwired,ha
1205,110933737.3,Edgwired,well
1205,110933740.1,Edgwired,i'm only telling him once
1205,110933744.1,Other,good
1205,110933756.1,Other,Maria's going to kill him...
1205,110933766.1,Other,or whip him to shape...
1205,110933766.9,Edgwired,"yeah, and that's before she's even moved in"
1205,110933772.8,Other,whatever happens first
1205,110933790.4,Other,that's what he needs.
1205,110933809.9,Other,but if he hits on her again... I'm going to hit him... hard.
1205,110933816,Edgwired,ha
1205,110933821.6,Edgwired,i wonder if he's ever been socked
1205,110933823.6,Edgwired,probably
1205,110933828.2,Other,probably.
1205,110933889.8,Other,he & I barely speak these days... when we do it's civil... but that's all me... i'm holding back until I move.
1205,110933908.8,Other,i wanna slip out quietly.
1205,110933914.7,Edgwired,i can dig that
1205,110933919.5,Edgwired,myself
1205,110933930.5,Edgwired,has been piped up pretty often lately
1205,110933941.7,Edgwired,probably to my own detriment
1205,110933942.4,Edgwired,but
1205,110933945,Edgwired,for some reason
1205,110933949.9,Edgwired,i don't feel like putting up with bullshit
1205,110933955.5,Other,yeah
1205,110933959.6,Other,i know the feeling

1205,110934003.3,Edgwired,ha
1205,110934009.2,Edgwired,not really
1205,110934016.6,Edgwired,not nearly as many as maria wanted me to say
1205,110934034.4,Edgwired,but i've removed myself from the issue entirely
1205,110934035.4,Other,really?
1205,110934046.6,Other,it's probably safer that way
1205,110934050.5,Edgwired,LOL
1205,110934055.3,Edgwired,truer words have never been spoken
1205,110934136,Other,trying to explain or question my mental issues is hard. Maria handles it well... but it's best to leave it up to her. She's keeping my interest just fine.
1205,110934152.4,Edgwired,um
1205,110934153.2,Edgwired,Wes
1205,110934155.9,Other,And she controls my issues like no other
1205,110934157,Edgwired,my advice to you
1205,110934163.1,Edgwired,is to control your own issues
1205,110934171.2,Other,oh I do.
1205,110934190,Other,but she is the motivation...
1205,110934203.1,Other,the looking glass.

1205,110934257.7,Other,who I forgot I was
1205,110934259.2,Edgwired,"yeah, she has a skill for elevation"
1205,110934269,Edgwired,but she's also human
1205,110934300.4,Other,i know... that's why it's the buddy system... I try to give back what she gives to me.
1205,110934305.3,Other,it good policy
1205,110934320,Edgwired,just as long as you give it back on both ends
1205,110934323.7,Edgwired,don't be her bitch
1205,110934328,Edgwired,it's unbecoming

1205,110934377,Edgwired,ha

1205,110934422,Other,;)
1205,110934436.5,Edgwired,in some ways she is very vulnerable
1205,110934443.8,Edgwired,like everyone else i know
1205,110934445.1,Other,as am I
1205,110934453.5,Edgwired,she fights back though
1205,110934457.2,Other,we should start a club
1205,110934458,Edgwired,if you press her buttons
1205,110934462.4,Edgwired,it's borderline irrational
1205,110934465.2,Other,boy do I knoww that
1205,110934473.7,Edgwired,but i totally understand how that happens
1205,110934483.7,Other,we take turns being irrational
1205,110934530.2,Other,and I also know when to step back and let her get it all out before I speak
1205,110934587.3,Other,it's about... patience.
1205,110934598.9,Other,im learning that again
1205,110934624.8,Edgwired,"yeah, i'm glad you two worked out your differences"
1205,110934637.1,Edgwired,i'm probably going to bow out of the scene for a while
1205,110934647,Edgwired,she'll need someone
1205,110934702.5,Other,you can bow out of the scene (god knows I have) but don't you dare bow out from us.
1205,110934716.1,Other,i'm just getting to know you...with her.
1205,110934770.5,Edgwired,"nah, i think it's going to be all inclusive. you and she will have your space, i'll be around but it's time to let that rest for a while"
1205,110934818.5,Other,boohiss
1205,110934821.2,Other,:(
