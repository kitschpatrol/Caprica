19,109531701.8,Other,ok ... well here is the exact breakdown ... the room i currently reside in will be vacant
19,109531724.8,Edgwired,k
19,109531730.9,Other,it is the cheapest room ... the room wes resides in ... is more expensive ... the rent will be $385 and $455 respectively ... for each room
19,109531766.4,Edgwired,ok
19,109531771.5,Other,"u need 1st, last, and security to move in" ... "so depending on which room u take, that decides the price"
19,109531788.4,Edgwired,ok ... thanks for the info
19,109531800,Other,i guess maria would have first dibbs ... because she asked first
19,109531812.1,Edgwired,she does ... we talked about it ... which room are you going to take?
19,109531826.4,Other,Juans
19,109531829,Edgwired,ok ... she was just concerned about music late at night
19,109531850,Other,OMG ... well ... Imri has no respect for anyone as far as that goes ... so good luck!
19,109531870.3,Edgwired,haha ... right ... i told her ... she needs to take the opposite room ... of wherever he is
19,109531890.8,Other,"honestly, i would have moved out if i had the money" ... i am stuck
19,109531895,Edgwired,man ... i've been there ... many times ... so ... are you still considering those other people?? ... ha ... one question mark
19,109531935.3,Other,there are no other people ... heheh
19,109531941.7,Edgwired,OH ... my mistake
19,109531953.1,Other,"about two months ago, i entertained my brother as a possibility" ... "and before we even agreed i was staying, i ruled that out" ... "then, a girl named kristin wanted to move in" ... "imri did not want her to, because she is young"
19,109531994.9,Edgwired,ok
19,109532005.5,Other,i had wanted my girlfriend to live there ... but imri doesnt want that either
19,109532026.3,Edgwired,ok ... so ... maria is coming over to swim in a minute ... can i just tell her that we should get this arranged? ... we talked to Imri about it last week ... and he was cool with it as long as we talked to you ... what i'm really trying to decide is how much money i can put on this party this weekend ... and still come out well enough to buy furniture ... "haha, my friend Dan says that he's listened to Breakdown 3 well over a hundred times and he wants a new one."
19,109532686.3,Other,haha hey ... sorry someone came in ... im at work sooo ... anyways
19,109532696.4,Edgwired,yeah ... np
19,109532716.6,Other,yeah so i guess it comes out to either 1155 for my old room ... or 1375 for wes's
19,109532736.1,Edgwired,ok
19,109532742.7,Other,i have to double check on the rent for wes's room tho ... but i believe he's been paying 445 a month ... but rent goes up this year ... so it will be 455 a month
19,109532766.8,Edgwired,ok ... i've got that down ... that's definitely good to know ... going to take the month to put it together
19,109532788.4,Other,im assuming maria would take wes's old room?
19,109532795.7,Edgwired,most likely
19,109532900.2,Other,u know anyone else looking for a place besides you two? ... i am just curious
19,109532922.7,Edgwired,"um, i've had a few people express interest" ... but nothing firm

20,103416575.4,Other,yeah that can be tough.....but its all just selling themselves right?
20,103416613,Edgwired,that's what they're pretty good at.. i think the retail strategy is dumb though... my opinion is that we should start with big institutional licenses and then sell to individuals
20,103416654.3,Other,yeah thats probably true. just as long as they keep paying YOU thats all that matters........at this point
20,103416659.3,Edgwired,HA ... right ... they said they would break their lease at the office before they stopped paying me and Gonzo ... so even if we do run out of money ... i'll have a little bit of a heads up

20,103418323.9,Edgwired,no kidding ... i'd love to still go ... but ... the interview that i had ... or at least one of them ... was basically them trying to convince us why we should NOT go ... and it worked
20,103418361,Other,thats strange....why?
20,103418368.1,Edgwired,well the one company was like ... "this isn't an exchange program.. this is like any other job that just happens to be in Japan.. you're not going to get to travel and the people in Japan aren't going to ever totally accept you." ... and the one patrick works for ... was completely the opposite
20,103418453.6,Other,damn that sucks.....not very marketing
20,103418472.5,Edgwired,i guess they get enough people who want to go that they can be like that
20,103418490.7,Other,well i guess it was a good decision then.
20,103418493.3,Edgwired,but on the way home from my trip i just decided that i wasn't going to fuck up something that i'm really enjoying

98,119073225.3,Other,u like doing it
98,119073242.1,Edgwired,i like designing it ... "painting is ok, but it's really watching the design come together that keeps me going" ... my mother paints faux finishes for a living
98,119073359.8,Other,no i meant like walls ... like living room wallks ... bedroom walls
98,119073371.7,Edgwired,right ... that's what she does ... she gets more into glazing ... sponge painting ... textures ... i'm doing some of that with my room
98,119073413.7,Other,u can design ... pick out colors for homes
98,119073422.6,Edgwired,yes
98,119073426.9,Other,ok ... and i am being serious ... here ... "i would pay you to come and pick out colors for my kitchen, living room/dining room, hallway, office, and bedroom and to paint it" ... i have not one artisitc bone in my body ... god ripped me of that gay trait
98,119073499.4,Edgwired,that sounds reasonable.. you first need to decide if you like my style ... i can design well ... but i design what i like mostly
98,119073519,Other,im just talking colors and paint

98,119073603.7,Edgwired,my stepfather paints everything a shade of tan ... neutrals go with everything ... but ... depends on how spicy you like to be ... in most cases ... i'm not very stingy with color ... anyway ... i'd have to look at your house again
98,119073682,Other,so u would look at my hosue and not me this time ;-)
98,119073719.8,Edgwired,that depends on how good you are at not distracting me
98,119073739.3,Other,but seriously ... how much would that cost me for 5 rooms ... including cost of paint ... i have no clue
98,119073867.7,Edgwired,"basic paint and trim without a lot of fancy shit is $50-80 per room prom, my mother charges anywhere from $350 - $1200 per room depending on what kind of finish you like" ... although i just spent over $160 on paint for my bedroom
98,119073934,Other,what u mean by finish
98,119073966.7,Edgwired,"there are processes you can apply to the walls to make them have metallic crackle, or look like leather, or look like denim, or have a stone finish" ... or sponge them to look like clouds
98,119073984.4,Other,jesus ... so complicated ... ;-)

104,119902300.7,Other,not much u
104,119902315.8,Edgwired,i've been thinking about your house ... you really want to paint it?
104,119902352.4,Other,yes but i didn't realize how much it could cost ... i may have to wait til after christmas ... maybe the living room before hand though ... just not the whole house right away
104,119902415.4,Edgwired,"I was thinking I could do the whole thing for $2000, but if you want to just do the living room, then it would be much cheaper"
104,119902417,Other,what were ya thinking
104,119902427,Edgwired,$2000 plus materials ... or $2500 materials included
104,119902463.1,Other,how much w/ materials do you think for my room downstairs
104,119902475.6,Edgwired,100 - 150 ... maybe less ... i usually end up spending over a hundred on a room ... put it this way ... figure ... 30 - 40 for brushes and tape and shiza ... $20 per gallon ... 20 - 30 per gallon ...

185,102285531,Edgwired,?
185,102285550.6,Other,I'm looking at pages 31-33 ... with me?
185,102285585.2,Edgwired,just 32 and 33 ... 31 stays
185,102285596,Other,absolutely correct ... so... ... "on 31, section off into Intermediate and Advanced" ... Alarm is in Intermediate ... Recurrence is in Advanced
185,102285631,Edgwired,k
185,102285635,Other,description of each next to the button images ... 33... zoom in on one date within DATE
185,102285734.5,Edgwired,for?
185,102285780,Other,"on this particular date, you will have one each of the four types of items (regular circle for a regular entry, clock for alarm entry, clockwise arrow for recurrence, and clock and cockwise arrow for an alarm with a recurrence)"
185,102285820.4,Edgwired,that's all fine except for the part of blowing the day up ... you can show each as an example ... without ... the screenshot ... because in this particular case ... the screenshot will look awful
185,102285849.4,Other,excellent ... just as long as it is clear that they are entries in a date ... and not just the buttons ... maybe have sample text next to them ... will that work?
185,102285935,Edgwired,sure ... send me the text
185,102285941.9,Other,ok ... working on that now
186,102287571.2,Other,ready for some text?
186,102287584.5,Edgwired,i'm not going to get to it until tomorrow at least ... but you're welcome to send it
187,102292641.3,Edgwired,"i think i want to get rid of the ""side bar"" and ""top bar"" parts of the inside of the brochure"
187,102292656.3,Other,and replace them with what
187,102292662.4,Edgwired,blank space
187,102292679.8,Other,get rid of the side bar and top bar images ... ? ... or text ?
187,102292684.7,Edgwired,text
187,102292711.2,Other,how will you make up for their absense ... ce
187,102292726.9,Edgwired,what do you mean?
187,102292864.4,Other,now that i look at it ... the information is awkward ... we display descriptions or details for the six applications ... "aside from that, only help and email"
187,102292944.2,Edgwired,it doesn't lay out well ... the way it is
187,102292986.9,Other,alright.. ... do one copy with text as is ... do one laid out how you see fit ... easy enough?
187,102293009.5,Edgwired,no ... that doesn't solve my problem ... because i still have to find a way to lay it out ... with the text the way it is ... if i could find a way to do it
187,102293039,Other,you can't just use a new screenshot?
187,102293044,Edgwired,then there's no need to get rid of it
187,102293047.7,Other,and leave everything else the same ... ?
187,102293053.3,Edgwired,no ... everything ... is conforming to one style ... the box ... the qrg ... this ... and teh dvd cover ... that's why this is taking all day ... i have the outside finished ... and the inside is mostly finished
187,102293119.3,Other,of the brochure?
187,102293123.7,Edgwired,except for this one problem ... yes
187,102293146.4,Other,you are still using a full page screenshot yes?
187,102293150.5,Edgwired,yes
187,102293194.1,Other,do some quick mock ups and let me preview ... does that help at all?
187,102293206.7,Edgwired,not really ... forget it ... i'll figure something out
187,102293236.1,Other,the problem with taht is that you may cut something that shoujldn't be cut
187,102293245.8,Edgwired,i'm not going to cut anything
187,102293250.9,Other,ok ... I don't mind working on the text if you need it shorter in places ... let me know if i can help
187,102293293.9,Edgwired,k ... thanks
187,102293349.1,Other,"i know that doesn't help you for shit.... but i don't have a good idea at present.... one that would preserve the brochure noting all six apps, and highlighting teh other important features"
187,102293360.5,Edgwired,it's fine ... i think i've got something
187,102293369.3,Other,ok

189,102295317.2,Other,the point is I am waiting for new ones ... before I send out ... they have old screen shots
190,102353786.5,Other,did you receive gonzo's email re: ftp?
190,102353817.3,Edgwired,"i got one about the email, but nothing about the ftp"

190,102354594.2,Other,well ... i couldn't modify them
190,102354598.3,Edgwired,they could have been changed easily ... in an emergency
190,102354614.5,Other,you are correct ... i could have replaced all the text ... I'm less worried about that to tell you the truth.... ... I'm going to set up a secure storage area ... to store physical media
190,102354676.6,Edgwired,k
190,102354684.1,Other,and I'm going to get together all of our printed materials ... and i'll probably need your help with some of it
190,102354701.8,Edgwired,k

190,102354789.8,Edgwired,i asked him two weeks ago if he needed any
190,102354795.5,Other,yeah ... i'm sure i did too ... "at this point, it doesn't matter, i have my solution to all these sorts of problems" ... and i will be working on it this afternoon ... its all part of my quest for actually organizing ssi ... how fast is your connection from home?

195,102362783.1,Edgwired,he didn't use the right buttons ... and changes like these ... are supposed to be cleared by me ... before they go live ... because you're right ... now that i'm looking at this ... it looks like shit ... so ... WHY
195,102362816.2,Other,esp if you minimize horizontally
195,102362816.4,Edgwired,wasn't i asked about this
195,102362820.2,Other,right ... this is all why i am stepping in ... i don't know who cleared those buttons ... i know i came in one day and they were there ... alright ... i just told gonzo to always put such changes on a non-live location ... regardless of who suggests them ... "and that they must be reviewed by all, esp you, before putting them up live"

195,102363220.9,Edgwired,nothing ... better nothing ... than something awful ... i gave him those fucking buttons WEEKS ago ... there were supposed to be three Not five ... he has three sizes to choose from
195,102363275,Other,there are four

196,102371499.4,Other,gonzo said he is aware of the black buttons ... the on overs
196,102371508.8,Edgwired,and the corresponding mouseoffs
196,102371509.4,Other,is that what you wanted?
196,102371511.2,Edgwired,they're all together ... they're different than what's there
196,102371527.8,Other,do then have the simplec logo on them?
196,102371532.2,Edgwired,no
196,102371557.2,Other,"ok, so gonzo has the states"
196,102371564,Edgwired,yes
196,102371567.9,Other,but the text needs to be put on all the buttons

196,102371594.7,Other,he does not have the same font as used in the menu ... is the text font that is on the buttons currently ok?
196,102371611.5,Edgwired,yes
196,102371612.9,Other,its arial
196,102371615.1,Edgwired,no ... the whole site should be... ... wait for it..
196,102371630.6,Other,what gzo used for those buttons is arial ... ok ... "the understanding here is that all text that is actually an image,, (menu, buttons, logo, etc) should be the optima or whatever font it is that you used" ... "and that the text that is just text,,, is arial"
196,102371707.5,Edgwired,no
196,102371710.6,Other,ok ... advise
196,102371717,Edgwired,the entire site ... all text ... should be helvetica ... the text in the menu is optima ... the text over the buttons he uses here ... should be verdana
196,102371757.3,Other,ok
196,102371767,Edgwired,"as far as i know, he rewrote all of the buttons with text overlays"
196,102371777.7,Other,they are now all images
196,102371778.9,Edgwired,if not verdana ... then helvetica ... if not that ... geneva ... if not that ... arial ... that's the way the stylesheet was originally written when i gave it to him ... if there are going to be four buttons ... they need to be spaced a little farther from the text and each other
196,102371900.8,Other,good point
196,102371904.1,Edgwired,i don't like them center aligned ... but without descriptions ... they won't work that well left aligned ... i still don't understand the use of buttons instead of the menu ... really ... i don't understand the use of buttons ... when text will work just find ... fine ... as it does in the rest of the site ... REALLY ... i just want to redo the whole fucking thing ... the dvd cover is done
196,102371979,Other,ok
196,102372003.3,Edgwired,fuck it ... tell gonzo to get rid of the buttons ... and make them text links like everything else ... if they want more prominence ... then put it in the fucking menu ... these buttons suck my cock ... the user site ... is supposed to use those same buttons ... by the way
196,102372044.3,Other,right
196,102372044.7,Edgwired,but i'm not worried if he hasn't had time to change them
196,102372048.5,Other,right ... the objective was ... "to add the ""showcasing"" of simplec functionality" ... "in particular, the email function" ... "so that visitors could ""preview"" simpleC"
196,102372089,Edgwired,fine ... whatever
196,102372095.4,Other,i'm not sure how you would put the email demo in the menu
196,102372098.3,Edgwired,text works just as well
196,102372104.6,Other,"maybe a ""DEMO"" section" ... "and a ""TOUR"" section"

196,102372113.5,Other,both menu items ... i know

196,102372147.1,Other,done ... i'll make a decision between the two ... "if i do text with descriptions, do you want a vertical list ?"

196,102372612.3,Edgwired,"you can send two copies, but i want to print them out and look at them myself before we send any more than that" ... he never sent me the beginners manual
196,102372668.4,Other,"ok,, here's teh deal, I have these two facilities that I would like to send this information to as soon as I can... people I talked to last week.... I can wait for you to make sure that these are ""kosher"" if you can do so early tomorrow"

197,102380211.4,Other,you have to work pretty hard to get pulled over on a bike usually ... "like,,, go 120 or something" ... cops just don't want the risk
197,102380233.3,Edgwired,but it's possible to ride that far without having to mess with the mechanics
197,102380240.9,Other,"depending on the bike,, yes"
197,102380249.2,Edgwired,what kind of bike would it tkae?
197,102380256.7,Other,just one in decent shape ... fuel injected bikes are far more reliable ... more expensive..... too

197,102380478.4,Other,oh yeah ... it was cool ... i just sat there and stared at it
197,102380492.2,Edgwired,i'd get to the middle of the bridge and need to charge it

197,102380626.1,Other,yeah ... they are very problematic
197,102380642.7,Edgwired,i want it ... why are the fuel injectors better?
197,102380694.3,Other,because carbeurators suck ass ... "they rely on atmospheric pressure and ""float"" bubbles, etc" ... fuel injectors are electronic ... and consistent
197,102380740.1,Edgwired,this is to get the thing started?
197,102380755.4,Other,this is what delivers the fuel into the combustion chamber
197,102380789.8,Edgwired,so what's like the basic bike that has this?
197,102380813.3,Other,they are too expensive for you ... forget it

197,102380952.1,Edgwired,k
197,102380959.8,Other,you'djust have to get it checked out before taking a long trip ... 250cc bikes are smaller ... and will be the most likely to give you the foot reach you need ... and less weight to hold up
197,102380997,Edgwired,right
197,102381009.3,Other,ok... i'm going to see if i can make a deal for a playstation

205,102545738.3,Other,eh ... briefly ... whats up
205,102545763.5,Edgwired,i seem to recall him saying that we didn't need illustrations to go with the text ... but i could be making that up ... for purposes of convenience ... because ... the text could definitely use illustrations ... really ... i'm wondering what he wants me to do with it
205,102545847.1,Other,i also got the impression that we were not going to do graphics on that manual
205,102545851.6,Edgwired,k ... fine ... better for me ... but ... diagrams would probably help in the long run
205,102545905.7,Other,i agree
205,102546186.2,Edgwired,so i laid out the qrg ... alarm thing ... and ... it's only a page
205,102546226.8,Other,sounds good?
205,102546235.3,Edgwired,not good
205,102546242.2,Other,i know ... i was hoping ... can you send me that one page? ... there isn't a whole lot explaining that the appointment icons appear in each date
205,102546591.9,Edgwired,do you really think there needs to be?
205,102546599.4,Other,to fill space.... yes
205,102546602.2,Edgwired,that seems obvious to me ... plus
205,102546620.4,Other,right.. but i think it would be clearer to a novice if you showed them an example of where those icons appear
205,102546623.7,Edgwired,they appear where they appear ... i don't know how you quantify thatt ... beyond what's there ... and anyway
205,102546646.3,Other,put a screen shot of the icons IN a date
205,102546653.3,Edgwired,ok ... well
205,102546661,Other,or is that completely ridiculous
205,102546665.4,Edgwired,i guess we'll wait until scott is finished ... i honestly don't give a shit
205,102546760.1,Other,what does it have to do with scott being finished? ... screenshot ... nevermind ... I don't care either ... i like the way you have it now ... the current problem is that blank page ... and that's all i can think of to fill it without losing functionality or being ridiculously redundant
206,102619196.9,Other,what's up partner
206,102619213.7,Edgwired,not much lucky luke
206,102619217.1,Other,ha

206,102619475.3,Other,are you in the office?
206,102619476.8,Edgwired,it's not a big deal for me ... yes ... but ... it would save me the hassle of coming back into the city
206,102619507.2,Other,right ... what time are you there until?
206,102619531.1,Edgwired,until it becomes apparent that no one else is showing up and i run out of things to do
206,102619547.8,Other,I will be there around 5
206,102619556.6,Edgwired,ok
206,102619564.1,Other,and if you guys don't have checks by then ... i'll get them to you
206,102619574.4,Edgwired,great ... thanks ... and then we can go buy a PS2
206,102619587.7,Other,"i don't want you guys to have to deal with late checks, ever" ... i'm sick of that shit
206,102619594.2,Edgwired,well hey ... that makes two of us
206,102619606.6,Other,iknow ... "ok, so the ps2"

206,102619630.3,Edgwired,and?
206,102619630.3,Other,i asked ... she pointed ... no ps2
206,102619637.4,Edgwired,fuck
206,102619643.2,Other,"oh, someone must have bought the last one"
206,102619645.6,Edgwired,:( ... you bitch ... that's cuz they know they can take that shit back ... best buy's return policy is deceptive and stupid
206,102619686.1,Other,yeah ... so i'm left waiting until ghettomart gets another ps2 shipment
206,102619707.5,Edgwired,ha ... did they have any idea when that was?
206,102619716.3,Other,no
206,102619720.1,Edgwired,right
206,102619720.2,Other,they get shipments daily ... but don't know when a ps2 will be on those shipments
206,102619736.7,Edgwired,fucking brilliant
206,102619748,Other,naturalkly
206,102619757.2,Edgwired,you know ... we live in the fourth largest city in the United States
206,102619771.5,Other,"wait,, youare in the office?"
206,102619781.2,Edgwired,I find it hard to believe there are no acceptable places to buy what is a pretty common consumable ... yes
206,102619788,Other,walk over to gzo and tell him to kill gambitdesign
206,102619789.2,Edgwired,in the office ... he disappeared ... but i'll tell him
206,102619800.2,Other,alright ... i emailed him tooo ... "yeah, i agree with you about the fourth largest city shit"
206,102619962.1,Edgwired,i forgot my mouse ... what is there left to do
206,102620039.5,Other,you have everything up to date? ... all printed materials?
206,102620073.6,Edgwired,i think so
206,102620102.4,Other,box?
206,102620110.7,Edgwired,yeah ... i forgot my mouse
206,102620115.3,Other,you have a final mock-up of the box ready to be presented ?
206,102620120.8,Edgwired,no
206,102620140.3,Other,so you are saying that you can't work on anything without your mouse?
206,102620148.6,Edgwired,i can ... just hopefully not the box ... the box ... right now ... is a problem
206,102620177,Other,why
206,102620185.1,Edgwired,depth perception ... lots of reason ... s
206,102620202.8,Other,but the old fuckers in the background ... the kite inthe fore ... i don't know what to tell you....
206,102620214.9,Edgwired,it's really not that simple
206,102620225.6,Other,the kite was supposed to be the centerpiece
206,102620231.8,Edgwired,yeah ... that's a problem too
206,102620241.2,Other,"if the concept is impossible, then we need to switch to a new one as soon as possible"
206,102620275.2,Edgwired,"probably not impossible, but it needs to cook in the back of my head for a while"
206,102620371.7,Other,"the only idea i would have would be putting SimpleC in the upper left, the kite in the fore upper right with string to the people or chair in the lower left background, and whatever wording in the lower right"
206,102620385.6,Edgwired,that's the idea ... but the angle at which your eye sees the kite in relation to the grass in relation to the chair in relation to the people (if there are even people) is precise ... and difficult to achieve
206,102620432.5,Other,gotcha ... the cd label is too red ... can we inverse that?
206,102620443.5,Edgwired,yeah ... i thought it might be ... we can ... but it's going to look exactly like the video cd
206,102620511.1,Other,"did jason not say to have the video cd read ""SimpleC Smiling Screens Case Study""??" ... "just curious because in the video it says ""Smiling Screens Case Study"
206,102620548.9,Edgwired,it says SimpleC Case study
206,102620558.1,Other,in the video?
206,102620566.6,Edgwired,i haven't seen the video
206,102620573.3,Other,that's what i'm referring to ... in the video ... it says ... Smiling Screens Case Study
206,102620616.4,Edgwired,would he rather use the Smiling Screens logo?
206,102620623.5,Other,no
206,102620635.2,Edgwired,then as far as I'm concerned it's SimpleC
206,102620638.2,Other,i think it is important to tie it to simplec ... what do you think
206,102620666,Edgwired,that's what i think ... i think ... that if we're going to tie in Smiling Screens ... then we need to talk about how they relate to each other ... because
206,102620687.6,Other,the idea is that we are/will send this video along with all other SimpleC materials to an assisted living or other senior care facility
206,102620691.4,Edgwired,we've never done that before ... what i really thing ... think ... is that the video is mistitled ... because up to now
206,102620714.2,Other,how SimpleC and Smiling Screens relate to each other?
206,102620721.2,Edgwired,"we were minimizing ""Smiling Screens"" right out of the picture"
206,102620735,Other,well
206,102620745.8,Edgwired,put it this way
206,102620756.6,Other,the only way it makes sense to me is that Smiling Screens is the company that produces simplec
206,102620764.3,Edgwired,"the SimpleC logo never gets associated with anything but ""SimpleC"
206,102620765.6,Other,and smiling screens was the company that executed the study
206,102620776.8,Edgwired,"if he wants ""Smiling Screens Case Study" ... then we use the Smiling Screens logo
206,102620788.3,Other,then we use SSI logo
206,102620805.2,Edgwired,i want to talk to Jason about it
206,102620829.6,Other,in your opinion... do you think the oganizations we would send this to would be able to make the connection?
206,102620845.4,Edgwired,i have no way of gauging that
206,102620877.9,Other,but you can give me your opinion
206,102620912.4,Edgwired,"well, i seem to be constantly overestimating the intelligence of the average person, but really, i don't see why not"
206,102620946.4,Other,"i think as long as we include a letter printed on SSI letterhead mentioning ""our product, simpleC" ... it should be cleaer
206,102620965.7,Edgwired,k
206,102620983.9,Other,i'd have to watch the video one more time ... to see how much simplec and ssi are mentioned
206,102621022.7,Edgwired,i'm not going to fool with it right now ... brb
206,102621035.1,Other,that's agreeable
206,102621227.1,Edgwired,k ... so what now
206,102621305.1,Other,"so, box is out"
206,102621310.8,Edgwired,pretty much
206,102621311.4,Other,vid cd label is out
206,102621337,Edgwired,yes ... i'm going to help gonzo with a video
206,102621411.2,Other,alright
207,102626451.6,Other,smilingscreens email and tutos are worthless ... so damn slow
207,102626468.3,Edgwired,i haven't been using them
207,102626470.9,Other,yeah ... i'm moving away from it ... patheti ... c
207,102626488.3,Edgwired,forward your email

207,102626533.5,Edgwired,ss email ... have gonzo change it to a forwarding account
207,102626557.8,Other,werd ... i just called Kmart
207,102627285.2,Edgwired,and> ... ?
207,102627290.2,Other,apparently they have PS2 in stock ... "so,"
207,102627300.9,Edgwired,riiiight ... go now ... NOW
207,102627304.9,Other,that either means that they lied to me today
207,102627305.7,Edgwired,NOW ... NOW ... NOW

207,102627313.1,Edgwired,go ... !

207,102627342.7,Edgwired,they won't have it when you get there ... everyone is here ... no one has gotten paid
207,102627354.9,Other,scott is there?

209,102888471.6,Edgwired,so what's the deal ... app Jason feels like shit ... gonzo headed to a meeting back uptown ... so it's just me right now ... i'm sort of working on the box
209,102888604.5,Other,alright ... everything else is done? ... you have the materials for SG to send out?
209,102888633.6,Edgwired,as far as i know ... no brochure
209,102888637.8,Other,ok
209,102888638.6,Edgwired,or qrg ... but he didn't really ask
209,102888700,Other,the brochure is done right? ... both are done ... as far as I thought
209,102888718.3,Edgwired,the brochure is printable ... i think that i'm going to take the scary white fuckers off the front ... and make it look like the box ... the qrg is also printable ... but if we were going to mass produce it ... then i'd want to go through and finalize the spacing
209,102888774,Other,no time for that in this case ... "well, how long would it take to finalize spacing?"
209,102888793.1,Edgwired,maybe a day ... maybe two ... not worth doing until were pretty much set on its content though ... and as far as i know
209,102888825.2,Other,yeah ... so don't worry about it for now
209,102888829,Edgwired,we'll be printing it out here for the forseeable future
209,102888842.2,Other,if sam want's to spend money on 5000 or whatever
209,102888842.4,Edgwired,"cuz it's like 5,000 for 500 copies" ... right
209,102888846.1,Other,that's his perogative
209,102888853.2,Edgwired,by the by ... do you think we could actually compute how much we've spent on printing up to now ... like come up with a real per page cost?
209,102888898.1,Other,yes ... i know the ink costs ... i know the paper costs ... well ... i ahve access to them
209,102888920.5,Edgwired,right ... i'm thinking
209,102888922.5,Other,you are trying to see if it actually saves us money?
209,102888930.5,Edgwired,pretty much ... sameer thinks it's 20 cents a page ... and i'm thinking it's probably less than that
209,102888950.9,Other,"well," ... how many pages does the printer say we have printed? ... "we just changed it at the 10,000 mark right?"
209,102888978.5,Edgwired,"well, i figured that there was a set amount for us to have printed when it needed that maintenance, so we could figure it off that" ... Exactly ... even include the cost of the maintenance
209,102888997.9,Other,200 for the mainenance... roughly ... figure about 500 for ink
209,102889024.3,Edgwired,so maybe 10 cents a page?
209,102889041.4,Other,you have to figure in that expensive ass paper
209,102889049.4,Edgwired,Ha ... the glossy paper?
209,102889056.4,Other,yeah
209,102889063.4,Edgwired,that we pay fucking $40 for 200 sheets?
209,102889076,Other,right ... $0.20 per
209,102889087.1,Edgwired,man ... we could get the paper cheaper though right?
209,102889113,Other,might be able to cut that in half ... so you are talking $20 per ... err ... .20 per ... brochure

209,102889253,Other,well ... we could get ink costs down by getting aftermarket ... we need to monitor the stripe issue

221,103144368.9,Edgwired,burciago ... the pic has to be 300dpi ... at least ... and royalty free ... its' not findable on the web ... this is what we have to use
221,103144429.4,Other,http://www.inmagine.com/bsearch.php?tb1=kite&setgroup=1&start=1&end=20&btnG=Search
221,103144467.9,Edgwired,"when we started doing this, i looked at 3000 pictures of kites" ... i found maybe 4 that worked ... and they told me that i had to figure it out for free
221,103144494.9,Other,we spent $60 dollars on a fucking kite ... at the time you were giving the option of a very expensive image
221,103144509.5,Edgwired,instead of $5000 for the picture
221,103144512.3,Other,right ... the image i just sent you is reasonably priced
221,103144558.3,Edgwired,$180?
221,103144563.5,Other,yeah ... http://www.photos.com/en/search/close-up?oid=2710771&a=&pt=&k_mode=&k_exc=&cid=&date=&k_var=kite&bl=%2Fen%2Fsearch%2Findex%3Fk_var%3Dkite%26big%3D1%26ppage%3D4%26srch%3DSearch%26first%3D33&ofirst=&srch=Y&hoid=946fc6df9bc771586441e4634b9a1f73
221,103144717.8,Edgwired,"i was told they're ""Too much like MSN"
221,103144741.7,Other,the entire idea is too much like msn
221,103144769.1,Edgwired,i'm just saying what i heard
221,103144772.1,Other,i know
221,103144784.3,Edgwired,i did go through all of these pictures
221,103144788.2,Other,ok ... i'll stop annoying you then ... airbrush one ;)
221,103144832.8,Edgwired,i just spent the last 20 minutes thinking about painting one over the weekend
222,103144951,Other,is there another idea we could use? ... this is taking entirely way too much time and effort
222,103144965.5,Edgwired,"i tried to talk to them about that yesterday and they were like, ""No.:"
222,103144974.9,Other,who did you talk to ... do you have any other ideas already?
222,103144987,Edgwired,"Sameer launched into a ""this should have been done weeks ago"" rather than actually discussing what we should do" ... my only ideas were to get rid of at least one of the things ... either the grass ... or the kit ... or the chair
222,103145035.4,Other,i've seen teh grass
222,103145036.9,Edgwired,we own a picture that we could use
222,103145038,Other,it looks like grass ... which one?
222,103145053.5,Edgwired,the old people sitting with the picnic basket in the grass
222,103145059.7,Other,fuck it
222,103145060.8,Edgwired,but Jason is dead set on the kite
222,103145062.9,Other,why don't we use that ... alright ... well ... i have nothing further then
222,103145076.7,Edgwired,exactly
222,103145078.5,Other,the kite is too difficult ... you can't make one from stratch ... and expect it to look like its flying
222,103145107.9,Edgwired,the direction i was giving ... was ... "put something together no matter WHAT it looks like, and we can talk about it then"
222,103145128.7,Other,yes ... do that ... asap ... just slap the bitch together
222,103145143.3,Edgwired,i'm trying
222,103145144.2,Other,its not worth putting lots of time into it ... we need another idea ... that's the problem
222,103145173.6,Edgwired,plan b ... is exactly what i asked for ... i said ... if this doesn't work ... then what ... and it was ... make it work ... and really ... i don't have any other good ideas ... that don't involve what we've been doing
222,103145279.5,Other,what do you mean by that? ... that don't invole what we've been doing
222,103145294.9,Edgwired,i mean the only things i've been thinking about involve grass and kites and chairs
222,103145376.7,Other,ahh
222,103145561.8,Edgwired,http://www.caustik.com/cxbx/index.htm
222,103145574.5,Other,help me with this email...
222,103145579.3,Edgwired,k
222,103145585.5,Other,i am trying to explain why we are *fucked* ... in terms of the box ... "1. Kites cannot be made from scratch to look like they are real, much less flying. 2. Royalty FREE images ARE available, but have been ruled out because they: cost WAY too much (>$200), and the reasonably priced ones are either ""too much like MSN"". 3. We have rejected the option of having a ""Plan B""."
222,103145612.5,Edgwired,dude ... leave it alone ... seriously
222,103145619.1,Other,why?
222,103145619.5,Edgwired,i mean ... i appreciate that
222,103145623.4,Other,this is ridiculous
222,103145628,Edgwired,but this has been going on for weeks ... and it's going to cause huge problems
222,103145635.6,Other,ah ... grrrrrrrrrrrrr ... honestly ... the kite we have does not look like a traditional kite
222,103145772.7,Edgwired,i know ... i pointed it out ... he doesn't care
222,103145816,Other,cool ... alright ... slap it together ... what idiots
222,103145846,Edgwired,it would be a good idea if we had the money to do it easily
222,103145850.8,Other,yeah
222,103145852.9,Edgwired,but it's not a good idea trying to do it for nothing
222,103145854.3,Other,just buy the image
222,103145856.4,Edgwired,and it was my idea ... and i don't think it's a great idea
222,103145987,Other,there should have been another idea that could have been executed without all this ... a picture of a rose ... or whatever
222,103146005.3,Edgwired,well ... at least there should have been the willingness to accept it
222,103146022.8,Other,why don't we just go after a picture of a helicopter over a south american moutnain top with a real cougar inthe background ... draw that ... i don't think they get it
222,103146051,Edgwired,honestly ... i can't comprehend where they're coming from ... which is probably why this isn't working very well ... and i'm sure the situation is mutual ... because everytime i try to explain it
222,103146094.7,Other,you get told to just do it
222,103146098.6,Edgwired,my explanation basically gets ignored
222,103146109.9,Other,help me write it
222,103146112.5,Edgwired,it's my fault ... because i'm still trying to do it ... seriously ... it's not going to accomplish anything but pissing jason and sameer off ... they already *know*
222,103146164.2,Other,ok ... "empty chair in background facing us.. string from chair to kite in foreground, large enough to put SimpleC logo on one wing" ... is that the idea?
222,103146343.5,Edgwired,ha ... i knew nothing about SimpleC on the wing
222,103146353.7,Other,i just made it up ... thought i would throw that into the mix ... can we hang in office and use fan ?
222,103146586.6,Edgwired,been done ... sans fan
222,103146602,Other,mit fan could be better?
222,103146632.6,Edgwired,no idea ... really
222,103148315.9,Other,i have a friend who just got a powerbook ... with 10.3
222,103148323.6,Edgwired,k
222,103148329.4,Other,how do you set it so the icons pop up when you roll over at the obttom
222,103148347.8,Edgwired,go to the apple menu and turn magnification on in the dock
222,103148499.4,Other,werd
222,103148694.3,Edgwired,this isn't going to work

223,103218915,Other,yeah ... my email would have had a little more spice ... but i think yours is better ... "again, i go for the Rumsfeld"
223,103218962.4,Edgwired,ha ... yeah ... i deleted a few sentences

223,103219339.6,Edgwired,much
223,103219400.4,Other,i figure it's something you can at least work with ... certain things like how i re-use the italics in the keys definition ... i'm not sure of ... and leave up to you ... "well, all of it i leave up to you,,," ... but i think you know what i mean
223,103219455.7,Edgwired,yup ... just make the rest of hte text like that ... and it will be ready to go

225,103224197.4,Other,well ... he's trying to replace an instructor ... i see what he's doing ... but what we should be doing ... is shooting a video ... what needs to be done is make a video that is soley screen shots and voice overs ... errr.... shots of teh computer screen while going through the processes

237,103648705.6,Edgwired,hmmm ... maybe as a compromise ... i'll show you something else
237,103648721.6,Other,nah nah nah... come on ... there's nothing to lose
237,103648751.3,Edgwired,we lose the anticipation ... probably the best thing of all
237,103648756.4,Other,not at all ... "it'll be a nice introduction into the ""first drafts review process"
237,103648851.5,Edgwired,here's what you're getting: ... i'll send you one of the three brochure covers i did ... think of it as a sort of trailer
237,103649181.7,Other,i really like that picture
237,103649188.2,Edgwired,as do i
237,103649214,Other,box fronts please
237,103649228.9,Edgwired,main non
237,103649246.7,Other,i hope that means yes ... here come the files
237,103649307.7,Edgwired,this girl has amazing taste in music ... and a fat pipe ... what more could you ask for
237,103649330.6,Other,this cover for the brochure cannot be produced on our printer
237,103649340.6,Edgwired,how come?
237,103649345.8,Other,"well,,, for distribution anyway" ... because it uses too much color
237,103649379.1,Edgwired,i suppose that's why there is more than one version ... although ... i find it odious
237,103649398.6,Other,odi was a happy dog
237,103649422.4,Edgwired,odi wasn't arbitrarily restrained from genius
237,103649440.9,Other,i didn't say anything about restraint ... its a great cover to order from a printer ... another point..... ... maybe that restraint then provides grounds for even greater genius
237,103649530.4,Edgwired,bullshit
237,103649537.1,Other,IF there were any restraint at all
237,103649537.2,Edgwired,that's the problem we had with the box in the first place
237,103649539.1,Other,which there isn't ... the box is a huge bitching issue ... on both sides ... myself excluded at the moment
237,103649580.8,Edgwired,"well, just so you know, i'm not wrong" ... in case you were wondering
237,103649591,Other,its not about right or wrong ... its about expectations ... not being met on either side
237,103649630.6,Edgwired,damn you madonna ... crashed a fucking again ... i think i shall have to resort to more urbane climes ... "on the plus side, my shpongle is coming through"
237,103649684.6,Other,ha ... "well,, check this out" ... I had a big heated conversation with scott and sameer the other day
237,103649751.9,Edgwired,about?
237,103649756.9,Other,eh ... delays ... in the company in general
237,103649801.2,Edgwired,did you come to a conclusions?
237,103649810.5,Other,and regardless of who points fingers where ... we all agreed we need to get stuff done quicker ... i made some points about resources and their availability ... people and their availability ... and the mis-direction ... on and on and on ... in the end ... organization is the only solution ... as always ... "but," ... this time ... I was told that I have ultimate authority ... in terms of ... telling jason and sameer and scott to step off ... when i need to ... or when they begin to hinder productivity
237,103649914.8,Edgwired,dun dun dun ... don't let it go to your head
237,103649923.7,Other,i was actually instructed to do so ... right ... i could care less ... it is just a difference in how i react to them slowing our company down ... which is the proper perspective ... vs my previous.... well they are just slowing their company down ... which was my fault ... at any rate ... I'd like to have more review (preview) processes built into most company projects ... "while, I don't necessarily need to see anything right now... I don't see how it would upset the process any.... and I actually believe it could only help..." ... what do you think?
237,103650086.6,Edgwired,"i was in the middle of typing, ""as long as they don't include the box" ... :)
237,103650093.1,Other,your an ass ... you know that don't you
237,103650101.2,Edgwired,YES ... .
237,103650104.1,Other,good ... that's the only way to be ... why is the box such a touchy issue?
237,103650156.1,Edgwired,no touchy
237,103650167.5,Other,"well, non-compliant issue"
237,103650175.9,Edgwired,mostly because it's fun ... and because ... i want to print them out ... because i can't tell what they look like ... on screen
237,103650212.6,Other,i understand that... and i'm not going to stop you from printing anything
237,103650214.1,Edgwired,so printing is the real preview
237,103650227.8,Other,"well, i'm less critical of screen vs print"
237,103650228,Edgwired,and ... really ... to keep the creative process holy
237,103650263.9,Other,so you can finish the ideas before you get feedback on them?
237,103650268,Edgwired,yes
237,103650277.2,Other,what if I vow not to give feedback ... non whatsoever
237,103650306.7,Edgwired,you're going to hate this answer ... but ... that's not possible ... because whether or not you say anything ... you still think it ... and thereby influence the process
237,103650340.9,Other,you're that easily influenced?
237,103650342.7,Edgwired,karma is a bitch
237,103650346.4,Other,ha
237,103650361,Edgwired,"no, dan, i'm just a sensitive kind of guy"
237,103650377.9,Other,alright ... we are going to work on setting review deadlines ... so there isn't this misunderstanding
237,103650411.9,Edgwired,k ... my review deadline for the box was when Jason gets back
237,103650427.5,Other,right
237,103650437.9,Edgwired,so from my point of view i'm sticking to the deadline
237,103650441.7,Other,right
237,103650454.4,Edgwired,k ... i'm not usually late
237,103650461.7,Other,if we are going to be an inflexible beaurocratic bitch of a company
237,103650464,Edgwired,with many things
237,103650481.9,Other,ok... that was my last shot
237,103650484.9,Edgwired,ha ... and i'm spent
237,103650501.5,Other,pretty much ... i just like to acclerate things ... "because, unless you haven't noticed.... we still aren't making any money"
237,103650534.9,Edgwired,TRUE ... but ... not my issue
237,103650544.4,Other,it is everyone's issue
237,103650549.9,Edgwired,i disagree
237,103650550.6,Other,you own part of the company as well
237,103650553,Edgwired,it's marketing's issue
237,103650560.7,Other,there you go
237,103650561.7,Edgwired,i do what i do the best i can do it
237,103650562.2,Other,box needed
237,103650570.2,Edgwired,given what i have
237,103650582,Other,and the circumstances dealt
237,103650590.2,Edgwired,"and on this particular thing, i'm not giving in" ... because
237,103650592.7,Other,beleive me.. .i've preached that a lot
237,103650606.4,Edgwired,the box is going nowhere until the fools return from San Francisco
237,103650611.6,Other,and the conclusion was drawn as ... "Do something about it, it is your job, take it as your responsiblity and make changes" ... so it is entirely on my shoulders now
237,103650647,Edgwired,the box? ... or everything in general?
237,103650668.6,Other,"well, let's agree on after they get back i guess, since that was said before this was established" ... "managing in general, yes" ... not vision ... or direction
237,103650697.7,Edgwired,you're in charge?
237,103650701.7,Other,yes ... if i need resources ... i have to make them happen ... "if something i'm a part of doesn't get done, it is my fault" ... because i didn't make the necessary events occur
237,103650766.4,Edgwired,at some point ... in the near future ... "i hope we quit changing how things get done, because I have trouble keeping up"
237,103650796.2,Other,i agree ... i think this was a failure on my part just as much as anyone... because prior to now i have been giving excuses as answers for delays ... "like... well, this person wasn't available, or whatever"
237,103650849.8,Edgwired,what you've described to me still isn't a functional heirarchy
237,103650868.1,Other,what is ... and why not
237,103650905.7,Edgwired,the roles of the managers are not defined in such a way that information is centralized
237,103650936.7,Other,how so?
237,103650987.3,Edgwired,"on a purely operational level, who's telling who to do what in which case isn't at all clear" ... "as it relates to me, there isn't any defined person that i can work with to make decisions" ... and it works soooo much better if there is only one person
237,103651092.9,Other,"i meet with 3, i get vision and direction, i execute, meaning I tell whomever I need to whatever i need to get done" ... you get decisions from me ... whether or not it has to be finally reviewed by others
237,103651115.5,Edgwired,that isn't what Jason and I discussed
237,103651118.1,Other,the decision will come from me
237,103651214.2,Edgwired,"i have enough experience doing this that i know that my job only works when i've got a direct line to whoever is making the final, FINAL decision" ... because otherwise we run around in circles ... doing stupid shit ... so if there's a vision ... i need to hear it directly ... because that's what i work with
237,103651300.1,Other,i don't disagree necessarily ... and... that point will be brought up
237,103651328.1,Edgwired,i've brought it up with Jason ... and to my knowledge he understands this
237,103651339.2,Other,right
237,103651344.9,Edgwired,so i don't know where Sameer and Scott fit into it
237,103651379.2,Other,the only solution is for you or me to talk with them about it
237,103651399.5,Edgwired,"if you're talking about you managing me and Gonzo, because that's all there is right now, then i think it's silly because it's really you managing Gonzo, which is silly"
237,103651429.2,Other,its coordination
237,103651430.7,Edgwired,in a larger organization this might make sense
237,103651436.8,Other,alright ... "well," ... the company is completely failing to meet deadlines ... everyone included ... that is the problem ... and nobody takes responsibility ... they point fingers ... you say that its jason and other fault for insisting on kite ... they say its you being a bottleneck ... I point out everything ... that i can think of ... that causes the problem
237,103651523.1,Edgwired,i am absolutely not responsible for the delivery date of this box ... when it was such an emergency to have ... we didn't have the money to print it ... and the date slipped ... and then ... Beryl was going to print it ... and the date slipped ... and now it's this conference ... so PLEASE ... take that back ... because i GET my shit done on TIME ... i don't arrange my priorities ... THEY do
237,103651591.9,Other,I didn't say anything to the contrary ... i said nearly the exact same thing
237,103651619.7,Edgwired,well he can take that bottleneck shit and shove it up his ass
237,103651656.3,Other,the entire company needs to be more efficient ... the way the company works ... because ... it isn't
237,103651728.4,Edgwired,"this is entirely an organizational management issue, of which i have no one to manage, so the efficiencies are not going to be seen by harassing my work"
237,103651741.1,Other,i'm not harassing anything
237,103651764.9,Edgwired,i'm saying you're not going to get the art any faster than you ask for it
237,103651775.6,Other,right ... "and if we continue to throw projects into the mix at the last moment, then it will take even longer"
237,103651823.3,Edgwired,that's also organizational management
237,103651826.9,Other,right ... I agree ... that's why it makes sense to have a person planning all this shit and then managing it as well
237,103651878.6,Edgwired,"i hate to tell you this burciago, but you can't manage by proxy with those three" ... you shouldn't be directly responsible for their bad decisions ... they should
237,103651934.5,Other,right.....
237,103651957.1,Edgwired,esp when they're directly responsible for their good decisions ... in any event
237,103651976.6,Other,TRUE ... but if they are focused on doing their individual tasks and need someone to coordinate ... then that should be possible ... as long as it is planned and communicated
237,103652006.6,Edgwired,so you're the COO?
237,103652021.2,Other,ha ... LOL ... "unless jason wants to be,,, which i don't think he does a good job of doing specific parts of that job"
237,103652067.1,Edgwired,but that's what i'm saying ... either your ... it ... or you're not ... not ... only when Jason doesn't want to be
237,103652080.8,Other,i completely agree
237,103652092.6,Edgwired,so we still have a problem
237,103652111.4,Other,i think that if they want me to take that specific responsiblity of managing.. they need to give me the authority that goes along with it ... "otherwise, it doesn't work" ... "and personally, i have no ego driven attachment to the position"
237,103652161.4,Edgwired,in my mind it ... 's ... no good if it's unofficial ... and really
237,103652172.6,Other,if he wants to be available everyday to ask you if you need resources and to coordinate what you are doing with others... then fine ... but i haven't seen him fully functional in that respect ... with the company as a whole ... "he's good for snap ""DO IT"" decisions" ... which some of the time contradict each other or other things in teh company ... "and in my opinion, hinder progression" ... even though it is sometimes perceived as moving the particular project forward ... EX.... making the QRG as short as possible.... ... it was an IDIOTIC waste of time
237,103652291.1,Edgwired,ha ... but what would it be like if you hadn't ... ? ... it would be 80 pages ... instead of 50
237,103652327.6,Other,no ... it would have been 50 ... the majority of hte time spent was not the text
237,103652377.1,Edgwired,TRUE
237,103652384.6,Other,which is the only functional difference between onur's and yours
237,103652395.6,Edgwired,not true
237,103652395.7,Other,as a result of jason and my time spent
237,103652399.5,Edgwired,ok
237,103652402,Other,*qualifier ... we spent many many hours trying to scrunch ... which was STUPID ... i had already reviewed the text ... and revised ... from that point ... it should have gone to you ... that's the process ... "not,,, lets see if you and i can sit here and fuck with it to see if we can get it down to 5 pages" ... thereby making it utterly useless ... these sorts of inefficiencies are all over ... someone has to be appointed ... i don't care who it is
237,103652510.1,Edgwired,fine ... but right now
237,103652515.8,Other,the box waits
237,103652516.8,Edgwired,that person still doesn't exist
237,103652521.5,Other,right ... i agree ... "they have tried to put me in that position, but without the necessary authority" ... is how i feel
237,103652566.4,Edgwired,i think you're a fool if you accept it that way
237,103652583.3,Other,"don't worry,,, it isn't a done deal yet" ... we have to wait until they get back
237,103652605.6,Edgwired,yes ... so ... what else is new
237,103652620.1,Other,"in the meantime,,, can i preview the box?"
237,103652623.2,Edgwired,Ha ... yes
237,103652632.6,Other,nice! ... Adding another level of management without the ability to give a final decision only creates further inefficiencies in a company of this size.
237,103652767.3,Edgwired,ha
237,103652771.2,Other,i think that says it all
237,103652773.3,Edgwired,three layers of management for 10 people ... is insane
237,103652790.3,Other,yeah ... i think they don't agree based on the fact that each of the three are busy enough with other things that they don't have sufficient time to manage ... do you think that is safe?
237,103652860.6,Edgwired,either sameer or jason should be managing ... sameer isn't capable ... Jason ... needs someone else to do what he's doing ... and only be a manager
237,103652901.7,Other,someone to take over business development
237,103652922.9,Edgwired,maybe in 20 years his ego would be secure enough to let someone else be in charge where he otherwise would ... but not while his parent's cash is on the line
237,103652958.7,Other,which is ultimately screwing things up
237,103653035.4,Edgwired,you know what i learned with a Management Concentration at Wharton?
237,103653039.4,Other,?
237,103653044.6,Edgwired,let someone else do it
237,103653053.7,Other,;) ... delegate
237,103653092,Edgwired,"nah, it's more like, manage from the rear" ... like ... the President isn't really in charge
237,103653106.3,Other,right
237,103653147.2,Edgwired,"unfortunately, they're trying to make you President" ... the only way i would run for president is if i could finance my entire campaign on my own
237,103653225.6,Other,"that doesn't make sense in light of as the president ""let someone else do it" ... which is exactly what they are trying to do
237,103653412.9,Edgwired,do you know what gonzo is doing with the website? ... i think i may change that one page ... in light of what you said
237,103653444.5,Other,it isn't going anywhere until there is time for a comprehensive review... that's my understanding... ... which... could mean nothing
237,103653507.1,Edgwired,k ... i'm taking it off my list
237,103653571.9,Other,what is on your list?
237,103653579.6,Edgwired,ha ... good question
237,103653585.6,Other,yeah ... should be just the box ... right?
237,103653594.3,Edgwired,pretty much
237,103653609.6,Other,i mean ... there are tons of things to do
237,103653624.1,Edgwired,list them
237,103653630.4,Other,TEA website and materials ... our website ... but you've already drafted that
237,103653700.8,Edgwired,simplec or smilingscreens?
237,103653706.8,Other,i was speaking of simplec
237,103653710.5,Edgwired,k
237,103653717.2,Other,what about SSI
237,103653738.5,Edgwired,i'm happier with it than pretty much anything else i've done
237,103653745.6,Other,ok
237,103653751.9,Edgwired,the text needs to be changed ... and it could probably be recoded
237,103653784.4,Other,right ... but that isn't you
237,103653794.8,Edgwired,not me
237,103653808.1,Other,wasn't me man
237,103653816.1,Edgwired,heh ... what else
237,103654044.3,Other,nothing
237,103654058.1,Edgwired,ha
237,103654063.6,Other,if you finish the box... then we can work on something ... ahh ... but you need to print
237,103654075.5,Edgwired,tomorrow
237,103654076.5,Other,you are looking for things to do now?
237,103654082.7,Edgwired,yup
237,103654258.7,Other,hahahhahahh
237,103654268.1,Edgwired,what?
237,103654273.5,Other,"sameer, do i have ultimate decision on the website?"
237,103654280,Edgwired,?
237,103654282.6,Other,"well, yeah,, i mean, for the first draft/version"
237,103654288.1,Edgwired,LOL
237,103654307.2,Other,exactly what we just spoke about ... anyway ... want to work on the website?
237,103654452.9,Edgwired,which?
237,103654455.6,Other,simplec
237,103654468.2,Edgwired,what needs to be done?
237,103654476.7,Other,i'm not crazy about the index page
237,103654491.2,Edgwired,hmmm ... i like it
237,103654506.2,Other,the paramaters are simply make the four options prominently displayed in a way that will spur people to try them ... "the only thing is, those four links at the moment could be interpreted to be just statements"
237,103654561.1,Edgwired,i am absolutely not turning them into buttons
237,103654573.5,Other,ok.. ... why?
237,103654589.1,Edgwired,"until we move the site to flash, buttons are bad design"
237,103654609.2,Other,what is bad about them.... refresh me
237,103654623.9,Edgwired,for one thing ... most reasonable designers don't use them anymore ... when text serves the same purpose ... at a smaller filesize ... an image ... won't improve the amount they stand out on the page ... because it's still ... text ... laid on top of something useless ... we have no pictures ... that correctly identify the ideas
237,103654763.3,Other,right ... that was my hangup ... that tutorials didn't have appropriate images ... features we could use the 6 buttons ... email the email button ... but tutorials and have a look ... nothing
237,103654837.4,Edgwired,the only way to make those stand out ... is to seperate them with descriptions
237,103654856.8,Other,one line each?
237,103654860,Edgwired,w/e ... just so long as there is black text in between ... images
237,103654870.8,Other,right
237,103654879.5,Edgwired,won't really improve the distictiveness
237,103654898.9,Other,"and not having ""simplec"" with the logo" ... no fix? no need?

262,104438968,Edgwired,do you think it's a bad idea to respect that?
262,104438969.3,Other,but she's worried about him being alone when he's so depressed or whtever ... probably not such a bad idea ... so long as he isn't doing himself any harm ... he's going to be really hard on himself

262,104439056.1,Other,TRUE ... but ... he's sorta like me in the respect that we don't fall on our friends when we need them the most
262,104439138.1,Edgwired,"you can provide him with the opportunity to put it into context, but ultimately he's has to come to terms with it himself, however he chooses to"

262,104439947.1,Edgwired,Jason was going to show it to Beryl who was going to change it ANYWAY ... so it was just to have *something*
262,104439961.6,Other,"they think that you are being stubborn just cause.... if you give them reason , you can work with them on it"

270,104864639.2,Other,if i have a set of music on my ipod ... that isn't on my itunes ... will that set be overwritten when i sync?
270,104864670.4,Edgwired,theoretically ... when something syncs ... it picks the newest date ... of whatever happened ... so if you add files ... they should show up in iTunes
270,104864688.2,Other,yeah
270,104864688.9,Edgwired,but ... i don't know what the real policy is ... as far as DRM is concerned ... only thing you can do ... is try it
270,104864715.8,Other,"and if its gone, i'll just get it from you again"
270,104864717.5,Edgwired,better yet ... back the fucker up ... and try it
270,104864738.9,Other,space issue ... but i'll figure it out ... "when i print out letters using the letterhead, there are little dots about half way into the page" ... and i also had a question about the taper on the right hand side of the black stripe.. it tapers in as you move towards the top
270,104865338.7,Edgwired,has it always been like that?
270,104865346.8,Other,i believe so
270,104865371.9,Edgwired,then it's probably supposed to do that ... i dunno about the dots
270,104865391.4,Other,aight

270,104865466.3,Edgwired,the second one is not where the dots are?
270,104865471.7,Other,yes ... the dots extend as far as the second smile
270,104865490.6,Edgwired,might be the quality at which you are printing it ... also might be the quality of the graphic inlaid into the template ... show it to me the next time we see each other
270,104865547.5,Other,alright ... when are you here next? ... should i try it at better quality ... i'm at standard now

272,104940127.5,Edgwired,k
272,104940132.3,Other,do you think it would be best to continue use of bmp ... or use a jpg or gif
272,104940153.7,Edgwired,are you constrained by file size?
272,104940227.4,Other,no ... i don't think so anyway
272,104940237.3,Edgwired,doesn't make a difference then ... IMIO
272,104940245.6,Other,usually they are large batches of the same form ... they are timesheets that get printed for all summmer weeks
272,104940287.1,Edgwired,it might print faster if you switched to gif
272,104940298.6,Other,is bmp better quality?
272,104940303.9,Edgwired,eh ... i don't think bitmap compresses the image

273,104941732.4,Other,these time sheets ... they were printing out tons yesterday ... nobody proofread shit ... then i went back to find that there were all kinds of errors... much less the missing sample shot ... my boss asked ME why it wasn't caught ... "and i gave the general ""because nobody proofread it" ... "i'm not responsible for the programs, just for making the behind the scenes shit work" ... there is a person who's entire job is to manage this off-campus work-study program ... hilarious ... and she was completely oblivious to the entire thing ... not even realizing it's her job to review all these documents

"Ms. Wintering,  First, as written in the SEMS Overview, SEMS Coordinators do not have the ability to create job descriptions. The role of the SEMS Coordinator, as described in the Overview, is ""...simply to monitor and approve their department's work-study supervisors and jobs. This role was created in order to provide departments with added visibility and control over funds allocated towards the work-study program.""Second, in order to become a SEMS Coordinator, you must complete the SEMS Access Request Form, available in the Coordinator Login section under ""How to Apply"". Simply print out this form and return it to our office via mail or fax. Finally, the SEMS Access Request Form is intentionally a hard copy form so as to provide us with records of both Coordinator and Business Administrator signatures. Please let me know if you have any further questions. I have included website addresses below for your reference."

281,105303842.5,Other,its such a fucking pain
281,105303851.2,Edgwired,by design?
281,105303857.3,Other,yea ... apple fucked it all up
281,105303871,Edgwired,to protect the copyrights?
281,105303876.8,Other,i don't know ... probably ... its stupid tho
281,105303882.6,Edgwired,or it's just poorly designed?
281,105303900.4,Other,its just the entire problem of not being able to truly sync
281,105303907.3,Edgwired,i wonder how many people try to do what you're doing
281,105303913.2,Other,who knows ... i mean ... its just a ppain in the ass once you have files on your ipod that you don't have in itunes ... and you don't know which ones don't match
281,105303950.6,Edgwired,right
281,105303952.9,Other,if I just knew which artists or whatever that i got from you ... it would be tons easier ... in this case ... i had to export all my songs from the itunes folder ... to another folder ... "putting all the files in one folder, not separated by artist" ... then i will download alll the ipod songs into another single folder ... then i will past them from the one folder to the other ... allowing overwrite ... THEN i will have one collectin
281,105304015.9,Edgwired,good lord ... do you have enough space for all that?
281,105304089,Other,yeah ... barely

281,105304367.4,Other,the point is that they don't let you go the other way ... no matter what
281,105304391.3,Edgwired,"i think this might, because it's date-based" ... maybe not though ... they might just be talking about the calendar
281,105304423.1,Other,yeah ... the calendar and contacts and stuff ... all that works great ... the way its supposed to ... just the music they screw with
281,105304451.9,Edgwired,definitely by design
281,105304461.9,Other,i deleted some of the stuff i knew i already have on my laptop ... to make it faster ... when i pull everytying down from the ipod ... i had already started to immport from ipod into the same folder as i ahd put all the itunes music in ... but the dumbass software would make _1.mp3 extensions on the names ... instead of prompting for delete ... which was infuriating
281,105304529.8,Edgwired,heh ... what software are you using?
281,105304550.1,Other,iPod Agent
281,105304561.8,Edgwired,this is supposed to help you?

289,105404686.8,Other,i understand how it works ... leave it for now ... what do you think about a phone icon button for customer support ... eh... nevermind
289,105404754.4,Edgwired,don't worry about that kind of stuff ... just decide what you want the content to be

291,105462116.6,Edgwired,got it from slsk ... what do you think about the idea of turning the user section into a flash presentation?
291,105462406.3,Other,instead of tutorials they can actually use?
291,105462415,Edgwired,still tutorials ... works the same way
291,105462422.1,Other,oh
291,105462422.3,Edgwired,loads differently
291,105462424.3,Other,i see what you mean ... yeah ... just have it as an option tho ... cause not everyone will have flash
291,105462444.5,Edgwired,they will if they're using simplec
291,105462445.2,Other,that's the only problem ... right
291,105462453.7,Edgwired,so...
291,105462456.4,Other,but those people don't come to our site
291,105462462.1,Edgwired,yeah they do
291,105462468.7,Other,but i don't care if they do
291,105462474,Edgwired,isn't that where they're directed when they open up the browser?
291,105462475.5,Other,i want the people who have not yet paid money for simplec
291,105462513.1,Edgwired,the real reason i'm bringing it up is because it makes the menu a LOT easier to deal with
291,105462517.8,Other,i know ... the only way we could spin that ... is if we listed all the programs that are included in simplec ... adobe ... flash ... ie ... "and put it in such a way that lets them know if they download or buy simplec, they have no problems loading any file, including flash" ... "there would be issues with using those names tho.. adobe, macromedia, microsoft"
291,105462616.4,Edgwired,nah ... they all have loose policieis
291,105462626.7,Other,what about icons

293,105467706,Other,aye aye CAPTAIN
293,105467719,Edgwired,only because i'm probably going to work my ass off to get them done
293,105467731.8,Other,how are you doing it? ... flash?
293,105467735,Edgwired,no

293,105468203.9,Edgwired,i told him to put the menu at the top ... and i guess reapply the stylesheet
293,105468237.3,Other,i think we are going to link to the forms tutorial as weel ... well ... and also use the buy page as the example in the forms tutorial ... if that makes sense
293,105468285.6,Edgwired,"um, sort of" ... as long as they don't actually order when they use it there ... but ... then again
293,105468299,Other,ahahah
293,105468300,Edgwired,it doesn't make a lot of sense
293,105468315.2,Other,the idea is that if you don't know how to fill out a form ... we'll show you how
293,105468324.2,Edgwired,eh
293,105468329.9,Other,"i mean, if you don't know how to use a form"
293,105468332.5,Edgwired,not the exact order form
293,105468334.8,Other,you aren't going to be ordering
293,105468335.6,Edgwired,that's confusing

293,105468355.3,Other,alright ... it can stay as it is ... we'll just link to the tutorial from the order page ... "should the ""Call 1-866....."" be at teh bottom of the order page?"

293,105468422.9,Other,and gonzo has what he needs to make these changes?
293,105468443.7,Edgwired,no ... not yet
293,105468450.8,Other,also ... "if you are in the site, say on the partners page, or contact page, etc... there is no title or indication of what page you are on"
293,105468547.4,Edgwired,there should be ... i've put titles in the files
293,105468700.2,Other,all the contact us forms need to have the right font ... all gonzo stuff right?

293,105470469.2,Other,right

295,105472359,Edgwired,cnn says it clipped a building
295,105472373.7,Other,that was after it was already out of control ... from what i saw ... "not too long after i rode in a helicopter above the grand canyon, a chopper crashed, killing 7 or so" ... in the grand canyon
296,105480090.3,Edgwired,gonzo won't have the forms with the menus by tonight ... it was a act of congress just to get him to apply a six line style sheet
296,105481161.4,Other,uhhh ... ok ... what was the problem with the style sheet
296,105481209.8,Edgwired,the stylesheet for the site defines the colors of the links and the text size/line height ... i have a mix you're going to love

296,105484954.5,Edgwired,i was just told the exact opposite of that
296,105484959.2,Other,by who
296,105484961.6,Edgwired,jason
296,105484964.1,Other,no no no ... he just asked me if you knew that it is supposed to fit inside simplec NOT 800X600
296,105484983.8,Edgwired,"the user site that we are using in the program size for 800x600" ... unquote
296,105485068.8,Other,The user site that we are using in the program. Size for 800X600. ... is that how it supposed to read ... ?
296,105485086,Edgwired,that's how i read it
296,105485093.9,Other,he must have had a brain lapse
296,105485101.1,Edgwired,well guess what
296,105485101.2,Other,it should fit in SimpleC ... what am i guessing
296,105485119.9,Edgwired,it wouldn't be a guess if i told you
296,105485127.6,Other,you quit

296,105485172.8,Other,isn't that just more work for later?
296,105485181.5,Edgwired,it's less work for now
296,105485250.6,Other,as long as the new site is up and fully functional tomorrow I don't really care
296,105485257.6,Edgwired,right
296,105485260.2,Other,we can change the size of the tutorials tomorrow ... or whenever ... soon ... "for right now, it would be best if we could have it fit in SimpleC... if that is not possible, then do what you have to"
296,105485394.4,Edgwired,where the fuck is Jason
296,105485399.4,Other,outside ... he'll be right back ... what's the problem
296,105485420.8,Edgwired,"onzalohbriceno@hotmail.com says: (5:28:38 PM) I cannot appreciate the stylesheet with the forms because there is almost no content. Send me a screenshot via email of what one of these forms will look like."
296,105485434.3,Other,his phone is here ... i know what the forms should look like ... menu bar on top ... form ... call us at bottom ... done
296,105485471.9,Edgwired,au contraire ... we're not even talking about the menu ... we're talking about the fucking FONT
296,105485497.7,Other,what's the deal with the font ... didn't you give it to him?
296,105485512.3,Edgwired,i'm sending you these conversations ... you can figure it out

296,105485640.5,Other,"all he's saying, as i understand it from him" ... is that there is no content yet
296,105485669.1,Edgwired,now that completely different from what i understand it to be
296,105485747,Other,ok ... situation is ... you gave him details on how to define text and etc ... he does not have content ... so is waiting for content
296,105485791.6,Edgwired,and i'm supposed to be the one that has it?
296,105485826.9,Other,how about this
296,105485833.5,Edgwired,"my understanding is that he doesn't understand what these pages are supposed to ""look like"" and he wants me to do this shit for him"
296,105485851.9,Other,just do the entire site however you want it done and send the files and we will post as is ... no recoding
296,105485861.7,Edgwired,"I DON""T HAVE THOSE FUCKING PAGES"
296,105485897.4,Other,right
296,105485897.5,Edgwired,"gonzo coded those pages, if i make those pages they aren't going to use his PHP scripts"
296,105485899.4,Other,he has the formes
296,105485912.1,Edgwired,and all i'm asking him to do ... is apply the style of the other pages to the forms
296,105485927.8,Other,ok ... that's done
296,105485932.4,Edgwired,and this has been a two hour waste of TIME
296,105485937.8,Other,its done ... as soon as you send the rest of the page ... it is done
297,105486047.3,Other,do your 800X600 for the user site ... jason is here ... do you want to speak with him? ... can i call you? ... im is fucking all this up

Thanks, George (Jiantong) Yu Senior IT Support Specialist The Wharton School University of Pennsylvania 3733 Spruce Street, Vance Hall 210 Philadelphia, PA 19104 (215) 746-4712" ... that's a fucking IT Support Specialist ... who can't read ... and can't figure out a very very basic interface ... how appropriate
307,106586079.3,Edgwired,"Senior IT Support Specialist" ... maybe you should be Senior? ... "Like ""Grand Master IT Analyst"
307,106586101.7,Other,eh ... i don't want to bite off that much ... i do like the idea

307,106586519.9,Edgwired,don't make no sense
307,106586521.3,Other,exactly ... good ... unified front
308,106592570,Other,lynard skynard
308,106592585,Edgwired,"isn't as good as led zepplin, IMHO"
308,106592593.8,Other,agreed ... "however, i hear them differently"
308,106592624,Edgwired,different concepts operating probably ... fleetwood mac does it for me ... everyonce in a while
308,106592849.4,Other,yeah ... not often tho ... just nice to have around ... little to emotional or something
308,106592910,Edgwired,"STop draggin my, stop dragging my, stop draggin my heart around." ... sing it ... i wish ... i had ... stock photos ... to play with
308,106593569.6,Other,did peck hit you up today?
308,106593574.5,Edgwired,no ... i think he knows better by now ... at least ... i hope he does
308,106593591.8,Other,he said hi to me ... i ignored
308,106593663.2,Edgwired,i'm not going to use photo rollovers right now ... it would be nice ... but ... going to take too long to find the right images
308,106593677.2,Other,eyah ... i see what you were talking about ... when you said you wish you had stock
308,106593704.1,Edgwired,i just sent an email to the unholy trinity about it
308,106593747.1,Other,the only thing that pisses me off anymore is sameer
308,106593763.7,Edgwired,yo ... i'll let you in on a little secret of mine ... "if you only talk to him like once a month, it's not that bad"
308,106593786.4,Other,yeah ... that's been my tactic ... i don't even care to see him outside of work at this point ... much less at work
308,106593824.6,Edgwired,i usually enjoy him socially ... but i can not stand the yelling
308,106594010.2,Other,yeah ... seriously ... the entire whining attitude ... i have enjoyed his company socially before... ... but anymore I cannot keep the work experiences out of my mind
308,106594122.5,Edgwired,he wouldn't exist in my world if he weren't paying for it ... LOL ... ouch
308,106594137.8,Other,well... ... we've covered taht one
308,106594216.6,Edgwired,"yeah, i expect that at some point he'll have the balls to say something to me, and that will be it" ... the rest of my options vest in two weeks ... less than
308,106594267,Other,werd
308,106594286.1,Edgwired,i'm wondering if we're going to renegotiate
308,106594293.8,Other,renegotiate what? ... your pay?
308,106594307.2,Edgwired,the contract in general
308,106594329,Other,i think project basis is best
308,106594333.7,Edgwired,i don't ... specifically ... because ... "i often i'm waiting on things i don't control to get a project finished, and would therefore be waiting on things i can't control to get paid" ... if they want to change it to a project basis i might as well work for someone who will pay the rate that most people get for projects like these on a schedule that's reasonable
308,106594443.7,Other,yep
308,106594494.4,Edgwired,so you think it would be better to look for other work?
308,106594520.5,Other,that is entirely up to you
308,106594543.3,Edgwired,"yeah, but you have more information than i do"
308,106594555,Other,not really ... if you are asking me about your job security ... i'd give you the opinion that you needn't worry
308,106594594.2,Edgwired,good ... because ... although you can't tell ... i really like the way things are ... the bullshit isn't really more than anywhere else ... and the work is ideal ... and the flexibility is ideal
308,106594661.5,Other,the only thing that i see happening more often than i think is digestable is your stubbornness with certain issues
308,106594668.4,Edgwired,HAha ... Daniel Frank and I talked about this
308,106594677.7,Other,that's about as frank as it gets
308,106594678.6,Edgwired,a lot actually
308,106594703.5,Other,many times you have good reasons ... and when explained... i think you sway more than you think
308,106594725.7,Edgwired,oh sure
308,106594730.2,Other,other times your just stubborn as shit
308,106594744.4,Edgwired,not as stubborn as you think ... because really ... that's just a front
308,106594751.7,Other,right
308,106594753.1,Edgwired,so i can decide ... but
308,106594756.3,Other,and i know it is ... but others don't
308,106594759.5,Edgwired,it's sort of built in ... you know? ... instinctual
308,106594771.1,Other,and they are put off by it more
308,106594773,Edgwired,will probably change ... as i get too old to argue ... much ... or care
308,106594783.6,Other,right ... you should care a bit less about what you do for SSI ... in my opinion
308,106594805.3,Edgwired,yeah ... we're getting there
308,106594813.7,Other,not like lower quality work ... just not feeling that the website or brochure or whatever... is static and on display in the M. Edgcumbe gallery... open for critique by the worlds artists
308,106594857.1,Edgwired,ha ... other half of that is it's what i'm going to use to try to get into art school ... so in a sense ... it really is
308,106594876.9,Other,right ... but ... you could also submit other versions ... "this is the version I was told to make by the jackass employer..... THIS is what I thought it should be"
308,106594914.6,Edgwired,i still keep the concepts ... nothing gets developed as much as the actual product though
308,106594944.8,Other,right ... but when it comes to making a rollover or not
308,106594969.1,Edgwired,HAHaha
308,106594977.2,Other,right?
308,106594981.8,Edgwired,yeah
308,106594982.9,Other,you get the point
308,106594984.5,Edgwired,definitely ... that's the kind of stuff ... that i'm just fronting on
308,106594998,Other,because it doesn't speed anything up
308,106594998.2,Edgwired,because really ... it doesn't make huge difference ... although
308,106595019.1,Other,from a certain perspective
308,106595019.9,Edgwired,i wouldn't argue the point ... as much ... if i didn't think i was right
308,106595028.2,Other,add them all up and look at it from jason's perspective
308,106595033.8,Edgwired,jason ... needs to leave my job to me ... like he did originally
308,106595055.3,Other,if he wants a rollover
308,106595057.9,Edgwired,most of the things he wants ... is arbitrary ... and ... even if it's small
308,106595067.2,Other,its up to him
308,106595068.8,Edgwired,most of the time
308,106595074.8,Other,at the end of the day
308,106595075.7,Edgwired,i've already thought about it and made a decision ... and turning it into a big thing
308,106595090.8,Other,right
308,106595093.2,Edgwired,by discussing it over and over again
308,106595093.6,Other,my advice ... tell him that you've thought of it
308,106595100.4,Edgwired,really isn't going to change how i argue the point
308,106595103.4,Other,and why you don't want it ... give him the opportunity to see it from your perspective
308,106595121.7,Edgwired,the argument is really to guage how important it is to him
308,106595133.5,Other,that's not efficient
308,106595143.3,Edgwired,not really ... but
308,106595151,Other,better to put your explanation out there
308,106595154.8,Edgwired,i do
308,106595156.4,Other,he does respect it
308,106595156.6,Edgwired,i have ... we still argue
308,106595163.9,Other,hey
308,106595165.6,Edgwired,and
308,106595166.6,Other,if you put it out there ... and he still wants it
308,106595174.2,Edgwired,i'm not the only stubborn person ... no? ... takes two ... to tango
308,106595183.9,Other,different positions ... you were just asking me about job security
308,106595203.3,Edgwired,yeah ... but my attitude is that ... i'm paid to make certain types of decisions ... and that if they don't agree ... then others can make them
308,106595232.8,Other,be certain in that
308,106595238.8,Edgwired,yup ... i am
308,106595246.4,Other,because they see it as.... ... you are paid to do what you do.... ... and you are an employee of the company
308,106595270.8,Edgwired,haha ... that's pretty funny ... because
308,106595285.1,Other,and if they want something pink and purple ... then they should be able to get it
308,106595291.3,Edgwired,that's not the way the contract is written
308,106595303.6,Other,i understand your point
308,106595305.3,Edgwired,i'm a consultant
308,106595307.3,Other,i get both sides
308,106595309,Edgwired,i don't get benefits ... i told Frank ... that ... "if they wanted to make me an employee with all that goes with that, and could afford a real salary, then i would be much more agreeable to showing up at the office every day and being less of an ass hole in general, but at this point, i'm getting out of it exactly what i want because that's the only thing that makes the compensation worth doing this." ... i can't live in the city ... so i work from home ... i'm doing the art ... so i can apply to grad school ... esp since the stock options were written the way they are ... they're not even being reasonable about that ... so my opinion is
308,106595585.1,Other,they aren't going to take them back ... or anything like that
308,106595610.9,Edgwired,"they're not valuing my full attention, so they're not getting it" ... if that was true
308,106595618.6,Other,valuing how?
308,106595619.6,Edgwired,then why write them ... they way they have
308,106595634.5,Other,"they"" didn't write them" ... i'd suggest you talk to scott about it really
308,106595652.6,Edgwired,it doesn't concern me that much ... because ... i agree with you
308,106595656.7,Other,i talked to him about this and he has gone though them again
308,106595664.9,Edgwired,that it's not going to happen that way ... but ... it's not the language that counts ... it's the tone ... they set the tone
308,106595679.9,Other,i'd say ... that if all you want is a springboard into grad school.. fine ... i'd say if you are interested in working for SSI in the event things start to work out to the point that we are compensated correctly ... then you are not laying good groundwork for that
308,106595787.8,Edgwired,"the only thing i'm ever interested in is making sure that what i'm doing at the current moment satisfies my happiness... in my philosophy, everything else works itself out"
308,106595798,Other,that's good
308,106595803.9,Edgwired,so
308,106595804.3,Other,i completely respect it
308,106595808,Edgwired,i'm satisfied
308,106595813.5,Other,i think i have a good understanding of the situation ... and perspectives ... and have for a while ... its been a while since i was involved in a conversation on this topic with sameer involved ... and i told him ... that he is getting a fucking earth shattering deal ... he seemed to value being able to control what when how etc ... to which i told him ... fine ... go get another graphics designer... ... "and hell, i'll even help you find one" ... but you will be sorry
308,106595937.5,Edgwired,i deeply appreciate you speaking to him on my behalf
308,106595942.1,Other,and it is a stupid move
308,106595951.1,Edgwired,he should be speaking to me too
308,106595954.6,Other,it is in my best interest
308,106595963.7,Edgwired,"because every time i ask him, he says everything is find" ... fine ... and i DO ask him ... i make a point of it
308,106595979.9,Other,maybe he's changed his mind ... i let him have it the last time this shit came up ... if he's to fucking arrogant and stubborn to see that i'm right ... fuck it
308,106596018,Edgwired,haha ... not much you can do either way
308,106596033.6,Other,he wanted project basis ... i advised against that ... he's just a lil boy with a control problem ... a whiney brat ... i don't think about him ... i don't deal with him
308,106596108.6,Edgwired,"we should give him the benefit that he's got major amounts of pressure on him... like more that i would choose to deal with.. but, you're right that he really doesn't know how to maturely deal with it"
308,106596124.1,Other,i don't recognize him as a working part of anything i do with the company
308,106596128.3,Edgwired,ha ... exactly
308,106596135.2,Other,i work with jason ... scott ... you
308,106596138.5,Edgwired,he's very far removed
308,106596140.1,Other,gonzo ... that's it ... sameer and roxana can go make columbos
308,106596158.2,Edgwired,Haha
308,106596164.5,Other,adam does his own shit
308,106596169.1,Edgwired,yo

312,106689189.2,Other,np ... on the tour page.... ... last screen shot ... first sentance ... your own ... is bold ... pace ... is not ... all should be ... Gzo? ... same thing with the last sentence
312,106690202.9,Edgwired,"sort of arbitrary, either way is fine"
313,106760911.4,Edgwired,"what kind of picture should i put on the order form?"
313,106761081.1,Other,picture?
313,106761084.9,Edgwired,yeah ... something in the background
313,106761097,Other,like a watermark?
313,106761103.2,Edgwired,nah ... a photo
313,106761120.2,Other,why would you do that? ... make it harder to photocopy
313,106761170.7,Edgwired,mostly because i think our order form should be of a good quality
313,106761187.1,Other,right ... i dont' think it is necessary to put a picture tho
313,106761205.3,Edgwired,ok
313,106761205.5,Other,because order forms should be easy to photocopy
313,106761205.9,Edgwired,nm
313,106761209,Other,but ... i really have no idea what picture you should use if you were to ... did you have anything in mind?
313,106761316.3,Edgwired,"sort of, but i keep getting told that we aren't using old people in our ads" ... so not really
313,106761332.9,Other,right ... i think it is time that we start moving away from old people
313,106761352.8,Edgwired,i disagree
313,106761356,Other,really?
313,106761358.3,Edgwired,yes
313,106761360.2,Other,why so
313,106761372.6,Edgwired,because that's what our market is right now
313,106761379.4,Other,why ... our market should be anyone with no previous computer experience
313,106761391.2,Edgwired,because this program isn't going to sell to a mainstream demographic
313,106761395.5,Other,we are excluding lots of people
313,106761412.1,Edgwired,it's a smaller subset than that
313,106761420.4,Other,there are tons of people who are not 65 or older who would use the software
313,106761429.3,Edgwired,maybe minorities
313,106761433.5,Other,nah dude ... i'm telling you
313,106761436.6,Edgwired,but anyone who's white and middle class is going to learn windows
313,106761441.5,Other,incorrect ... most people don't use the majority of features found in microsoft products
313,106761496.4,Edgwired,most users aren't going to settle for learning something different than what's used at work/school
313,106761502.2,Other,"my mom... occupational therapist,,, yes.. .uses windows for work,,,"
313,106761502.7,Edgwired,the vast majority ... i.e. Macintosh
313,106761515.4,Other,wants to use something simpler ... same with step mom
313,106761531.5,Edgwired,i'll believe it when i see market research
313,106761537.1,Other,same with most parents i talked to this weekend ... and PENN graduation ... when i present it as a product for senior citizens ... its always ... "hell, i want to use it"
313,106761574.3,Edgwired,in that case ... we don't have materials for anything but ... old people ... marketing materials
313,106761597.5,Other,i don't think it hurts us to expand to anyone with no previous computer experience ... that is what our text says ... but that isn't my decision ... as for the order form ... should be simple ... easy to complete ... short and sweet ... IMO
313,106761644.5,Edgwired,i was trying to make it look more like an ad
313,106761663.3,Other,for the final push?
313,106761666.1,Edgwired,yes
313,106761671.6,Other,i see your direction ... not sure i'm of much help ... are you at home or at office?

314,106770635.1,Other,no
314,106770670.2,Edgwired,scott just asked me to come up with options to replace it
314,106770744.2,Other,ok
314,106770753.7,Edgwired,i like it the way it is
314,106770762.9,Other,ok
314,106770782.2,Edgwired,so i'm sort of confused as to why this came up out of nowhere
314,106770816.7,Other,ask scott ... i have no idea ... Learn about SimpleC Success ... the orange around that is lighter than the others ... ? ... do you have the description for filling out forms? ... the short one i gave you for the lessons
314,106772713.5,Edgwired,i'll check
314,106772718.5,Other,thanks
314,106772729.3,Edgwired,orange is supposed to be lighter
314,106772738.7,Other,alright ... i accept ... curious as to why
314,106772754.4,Edgwired,to differentiate the columns
314,106772766.5,Other,are all of them different shades?
314,106772770.2,Edgwired,yes
314,106772781.4,Other,i only notice the last one as being different ... fyi ... i think it'd be cool if i could see the difference in all three
314,106772830.2,Edgwired,depends on the monitor you're using ... no computer will be the same
314,106772836.4,Other,yeah ... well ... my laptop ... my dell lcd ... my viewsonic crt ... none of them do I see more than just the difference in the third column
314,106772929.5,Edgwired,they get progressively less pink from left to right
314,106772951.8,Other,"i belive you, i just can't see it"
314,106773056.9,Edgwired,i can't find that list
314,106773074.9,Other,maybe in the mock-ups? ... i can't find it either ... and it isn't correctly listed on the website
314,106773095.3,Edgwired,what isn't?
314,106773109.6,Other,the rollover description for filling out forms ... i just found the description ... nevermind ... "have you completed the ""Download"" buttons?"
314,106773269.3,Edgwired,does gonzo have a copy of golive?
314,106773274.7,Other,ahhh ... that's the crux?

"head in the clouds" ... lol ... which used to mean ... aww.... maria is a girl ... yes ... still ... it pissed me off to hear it ... subject to the illogical irrational emotional rollercoaster ... definitely ... LOL ... I guess this is what i get in some ways ... "why the fuck do they call it a roller-""coaster" ... I did call for this time apart ... cause that shit ain't coastin ... last time i checked

322,107192226.4,Edgwired,come
322,107192242,Other,"Well, i guess" ... i mean ... not necessarily meaning you should step aside form the situation ... The thing is that as her friend i advised her not to go with it all ... "i'm just sayin,, in your mind" ... because it doesnt look good in the future ... right ... i did the same ... But i can see why she likes the attention ... probably why she's all about it... in retrospect ... "Yeah, safe"
322,107192295.3,Edgwired,if it was just the attention ... whatever
322,107192297.2,Other,at least a portion
322,107192298.4,Edgwired,but it's not

322,107192322.5,Other,they need drama ... if things coast... they throw the roller in there ... She said that ... though ... "Mikey, tell me" ... cause i know she was protecting a bit
322,107192353.8,Edgwired,"her mixed signals are: ""this kid needs to open his mind up but i'm not going to put in the effort to watch him do it"
322,107192367,Other,I see TR again ... a project
322,107192371.6,Edgwired,RIGHT ... that's fucking exactly it
322,107192379.4,Other,That is EXACTLY what i said ... but she denied it ... and i told her
322,107192387.6,Edgwired,yup
322,107192392.1,Other,you will get caught up in this thing
322,107192392.8,Edgwired,she's denying it to herself ... and lemme tell you
322,107192403.6,Other,EXACTLY ... and you know what i really dont want to bail you out
322,107192408.6,Edgwired,this isn't something she's going to stick with for the years that it will take
322,107192409.4,Other,they are so ignorant to themselves
322,107192415.3,Edgwired,ha
322,107192435.3,Other,So in the end ... nothing really changes ... It's TR all over again
322,107192448.9,Edgwired,not much
322,107192457.8,Other,"Fuck man, that is too heavy" ... all girls need their dose of drama
322,107192464.4,Edgwired,the abuse isn't going to be as bad

322,107192466.7,Edgwired,but ... still mental abuse
322,107192471.5,Other,"Well," ... yes ... especially with this girl and all ... you see ... I think
322,107192489.5,Edgwired,yeah ... she likes the torture of it ... it puts pressure on her
322,107192503.2,Other,its a challenge
322,107192503.5,Edgwired,to act with her heart
322,107192507.6,Other,But she said that if i said stop she would ... lol] ... the funny thing is that I called all this to happen
322,107192522.8,Edgwired,ha ... i think she would stop Tedi
322,107192533.5,Other,But whenever I got REAL close to some broad
322,107192533.7,Edgwired,but ... i also think you don't want her to under those circumstances
322,107192546.4,Other,I would push it all away last second
322,107192549.5,Edgwired,she needs to take responsibility
322,107192565.4,Other,"Yeah, but Mikey you know where she goes with all of this?" ... "Me, motherfucker!"
322,107192571.9,Edgwired,HA

322,107192581.3,Other,like she gets the brunt of my shit
322,107192587.3,Edgwired,but that's why i'm saying don't tell her to stop
322,107192588.5,Other,I mean can't i just skin him or something
322,107192590,Edgwired,cuz then ... you get all of it ... every bit
322,107192598.6,Other,dude ... But if i cut the head now ... youcan't be mad at him ... No i cant really
322,107192609.1,Edgwired,HAHAHAAAAAAAA
322,107192609.8,Other,i said that ... you're anger is with her ... last night ... or whatever emotion ... I can't blame him or be mad ... No really the anger is with me ... This is really all my doing ... And I understand that
322,107192650.4,Edgwired,that's true ... in the absract
322,107192662.4,Other,And am taking the responsibility for it ... That is why i told her that i dont want to jump back into it all again ... because she needs to do somehting like this ... good move ... in the chess sorta way ... but a lot of it is based on faith ... that in the end ... faith is for pussies ... My king will still be standing
322,107192719.4,Edgwired,tedi
322,107192724.5,Other,yes?

322,107192745.6,Edgwired,seriously
322,107192747,Other,"yes, i am cynical" ... Well i am confident of that ... but you know how it is ... you feel a bit belittled ... but this person ... by ... i meant by ... this person you never met ... What really made me mad was that the sex was in the room i used to live in ... and still sleep in
322,107192815.7,Edgwired,"yeah, i didn't like it when i heard that she told you that you HAD to accept her going to see TR" ... because you didn't
322,107192833.2,Other,I know that ... I am tall as Oak
322,107192847.8,Edgwired,with a bullhorn bitches ... thing is though tedi
322,107192877.3,Other,The truth is that she and i were friends before it all
322,107192883.1,Edgwired,if you really are going to be apart ... ... ... fill in the blank ... i told her ... there's no fence to straddle here
322,107192901.1,Other,agreed ... that was my main point at well ... "? So i should just split?" ... that is yalls advice? ... a break means nothing if there is a net
322,107192930.5,Edgwired,right
322,107192932.3,Other,that's all i'm sayin
322,107192937.5,Edgwired,you two have been codependent ... and ... now ... if you're going to not be ... then
322,107192945.1,Other,its all mangled ... Yes this is true ... "if break, break" ... "if not, resolve"
322,107192959.1,Edgwired,right
322,107192964.1,Other,Hmmmmm ... none of this.. see you in a week shit
322,107192966.3,Edgwired,either way is fine ... ha
322,107192981.5,Other,of course i'm all about black and white ... "Well, emotionally, neither is" ... right ... And our whole relationship is very very gray ... right
322,107193017.5,Edgwired,complex
322,107193017.9,Other,so either you two decide that you are going to work together to fix that ... and resolve all this shit ... or..... ... you decide that the solution is to take a real break ... Split ... yep ... Hmmmmm ... that way you each can free your minds for a bit ... "yeah, its a bit stressful now" ... instead of muddling around in the swamp of ambituity ... Cause that is a lot ... yeah ... i hear that ... well the ambiguity ... worked when they needed to work ... its a temp fix ... but i never brought up shit to the page ... that only delays ... "You see, i dont really feel like shit is broke" ... "and actually, we were getting along quite well"
322,107193125.7,Edgwired,TRUE ... much better than the winter
322,107193129.5,Other,but now i see that that might have been steming from some guilt ... from Craven
322,107193139.6,Edgwired,HA ... um ... he's a pretty recent development ... i think it was better before then
322,107193160.2,Other,yes
322,107193160.7,Edgwired,not to say it isn't contributing factor
322,107193173.2,Other,Well you see ... this whole thing ... is really making me step back and value a lot of things that i took for granted ... And it really makes me sad
322,107193227.2,Edgwired,mayhaps the purpose of such an experience
322,107193229.1,Other,because things were going ... so well for a while here ... "yeah, i said that" ... to her ... yesterday
322,107193255,Edgwired,but you NEEDED it to happen ... btoh
322,107193258.3,Other,I know ... "Yes, this is true" ... The timing is really really interesting though
322,107193283.4,Edgwired,HEH
322,107193286,Other,if this happened in January ... i would have said fuck it ... "then you get into the... well, do i want it so badly now that i've seen that i could lose it and it is now a challenge again" ... yeah
322,107193307,Edgwired,keeps it fresh
322,107193308.8,Other,"man, i need a fucking drink"

322,107193338.6,Other,LOl ... "Yeah, that's what it really all boils down to" ... This being something of a becon to see what ive not seen a minute ... and all that i have taken for granted
322,107193395.6,Edgwired,"yo, tedi, her affection is because she sees the same things"
322,107193395.6,Other,DAMN THESE CROSSROADS
322,107193402.4,Edgwired,DAMN YOU TO HELL
322,107193414.9,Other,Same things?
322,107193430,Edgwired,she says to me all the time why she loves you ... it's a spontaneous observation
322,107193445.6,Other,HA ... thats sweet
322,107193458.1,Edgwired,things she doesn't express when you're around so much ... mostly because she focused on being the witness ... and the adjuticator at once
322,107193496,Other," i know i love tedi, i know he loves me, we know we want to be together eventually" ... I can see it already ... "But people change in ways, mikey" ... and the big LET GO
322,107193527.8,Edgwired,always in flux ... and you have to let go
322,107193539.4,Other,can cause for greater change

345,107969958,Other,that's good
345,107970039.6,Edgwired,i want a hamburger
345,107970051.1,Other,me too
345,107974350.5,Edgwired,i think this flash presentation would work better as a straight video from screen
345,107974372.6,Other,what do you mean
345,107974402.1,Edgwired,most of the animation is just doing what you would do in the program anyway ... at least ... it could be ... and the rest could be done in video ... and ... the version of the program that we're selling right now has some pretty serious graphics issues ... that apparently didn't make the final cut
345,107974501.4,Other,ok ... you mean that there is part that could be done in video and the rest in flash?
345,107974568.5,Edgwired,eh ... not really
345,107974573.3,Other,and put the video in the greater flash presentation
345,107974578.8,Edgwired,i'm saying ... the whole thing ... as video
345,107974593.9,Other,what was the original reason for flash
345,107974599,Edgwired,sameer ... ?
345,107974604,Other,not person ... reason
345,107974612.6,Edgwired,i don't see a difference ... he said ... he wanted ... something like ... something ... that they showed me ... which was flash ... actually ... i don't remember ... before that ... when we started talking about ... it ... so ... i don't know ... but ... stepping through the email thing ... and changing the levels ... and switching between programs ... and using the help ... are all things that would look better in video ... than in flash ... pointing out the different elements ... would work in either
345,107974731.1,Other,are you really considering changing it now?
345,107974733.9,Edgwired,distribution wise ... flash is probably easier ... although
345,107974744.7,Other,i'd say complete what you have to for tomorrow
345,107974745,Edgwired,most ppl don't have flash 6 or 7 ... what happens tomorrow?
345,107974758.1,Other,and then worry about the rest later ... the presentation is due?
345,107974778.4,Edgwired,ha ... that's pretty funny
345,107974788.6,Other,was that not what you were told?
345,107974801.5,Edgwired,no idea
345,107974802.4,Other,when do you think it is supposed to be done?
345,107974802.4,Edgwired,really ... last i remember ... jason told me on monday of last week that he wanted it on wednesday of that week ... so
345,107974839.6,Other,ok
345,107974845.4,Edgwired,that translates to me as ... whenever it really gets done
345,107974856.5,Other,that fucking sucks ... i don't get how that means whenever ... seems to me that would mean asap
345,107974919.8,Edgwired,right ... what's the difference
345,107974936.1,Other,whenever is leisurely ... asap is not ... deadline of wednesday last week would imply that it is already overdue by a week
345,107975185,Edgwired,my grandmother just fell over in the yard
345,107975194.8,Other,go help her
345,107975198.6,Edgwired,i did
345,107975206.9,Other,is she ok?
345,107975211.6,Edgwired,yeah
345,107975226.6,Other,lol ... go help her
345,107975234.5,Edgwired,i DID
345,107975237.2,Other,as if you needed me to tell you ... i was just laughing at myself ... anyway.... ... i really don't understand why it is so difficult for you and jason to work with deadlines ... it's pretty pathetic really
345,107975338.9,Edgwired,jason's recent deadlines weren't set in rational states of mind
345,107975348.7,Other,right ... two to tango ... its up to you to tell him that and set one with him taht is reasonable
345,107975367.8,Edgwired,i did ... i called him ... immediately after i got the email
345,107975376.9,Other,when did you tell him it would be done then
345,107975379.2,Edgwired,and talked to him about it
345,107975384.3,Other,and?
345,107975387.4,Edgwired,i don't remember
345,107975391.9,Other,exactly
345,107975394.2,Edgwired,i'm not sure anything specific ... was set
345,107975401.6,Other,weak
345,107975405.3,Edgwired,not weak
345,107975409.7,Other,quite weak
345,107975410.8,Edgwired,followed on simple.com ... which got done yesterday
345,107975440.2,Other,there is no reason not to set deadlines for this shit ... lol ... double negative ... anyway...
345,107975472.8,Edgwired,it didn't seem imperative
345,107975474.2,Other,expect more weak ass arguments as a result
345,107975475.8,Edgwired,when we discussed it
345,107975483,Other,regardless ... everything should be clear ... otherwise it seems that all parties involved enjoy the craptacular situation that they perpetuate
345,107975553.7,Edgwired,eh ... i'm over it ... really
345,107975574.6,Other,then jason finds out that it's not going to be done tomorrow when he wants it ... and he yells ... and you wonder why
345,107975591.9,Edgwired,no ... situation has changed
345,107975603.9,Other,alright
345,107975604.1,Edgwired,i don't wonder ... it doesn't bother me enough to speculate
345,107975618.8,Other,"regardless, everyone suffers"
345,107975635,Edgwired,suffering is a state of mind induced only within the ego
345,107975642.9,Other,but... let's all act like sameer and i'm sure everything will work out
345,107975667.3,Edgwired,nobody yells like sameer ... except sameer
345,107975677.2,Other,doesn't seem to be an real desire to make a success out of this on anyones part ... it's always someone else's fault ... or i don't care ... or i didn't think this ... will a video be larger or smaller file size than flash
345,107975774.2,Edgwired,hmmm
345,107975774.7,Other,more or less quality
345,107975776.5,Edgwired,larger ... more quality
345,107975799.8,Other,in terms of still image quality ... or just that it flows better or whatever
345,107975825.9,Edgwired,"smaller image, better continuity" ... less processor intentensive
345,107975862,Other,the overall screen size of the presentation? ... how will that be affected
345,107975876.4,Edgwired,by half
345,107975914.8,Other,half the size?
345,107975929.4,Edgwired,roughly ... maybe 640X480
345,107975936.4,Other,that doesn't seem like a good idea
345,107975953.7,Edgwired,the screenshots themselves are 640X480 anyway ... in the flash presentation
345,107975991,Other,"ok, size of simplec on the viewers screen" ... how is that affected ... none?
345,107976006,Edgwired,possibly ... determining factor is end file size ... eh
345,107976039,Other,i'd do it in flahs ... flash
345,107976044.5,Edgwired,video is too long to be small
345,107976048.1,Other,that is my suggestion
345,107976049.4,Edgwired,file size
345,107976052.5,Other,right ... flash player is available for free correct?
345,107976076.6,Edgwired,yup
345,107976082.8,Other,no problem there then
345,107976085.1,Edgwired,also ... third possibility
345,107976093,Other,shoot it
345,107976095.8,Edgwired,video inside of flash ... flash seven ships with its own codec
345,107976114.2,Other,do we have?
345,107976118.8,Edgwired,i have ... not many other people have
345,107976127.7,Other,need flash 7 to play?
345,107976130,Edgwired,yes
345,107976135.8,Other,which is not free ... ?
345,107976141.3,Edgwired,is free
345,107976157.3,Other,sorta sux that nearly anyone would have to download tho
345,107976183,Edgwired,yes
345,107976205.4,Other,i wouldn't want to give a flash presentation to someone I was trying to convince of simplec being easy... all with the requirement that they download the latest flash
345,107976230.6,Edgwired,that's logical
345,107976235.3,Other,it seems that a regular flash presentation is the best way to go
345,107976293.4,Edgwired,k
345,107976354.6,Other,i think these issues can be brought up and addressed before the next version of this presentation is assigned/developed ... for now just need *something* to facilitate the demonstration of simplec without having the person buy/download/actually use the program
346,108053213.7,Other,whattup
346,108053218.8,Edgwired,nm ... "ytou?"

352,108424889.8,Other,i've heard mixed ... "about how pro has features, but is harder to use"
352,108424900.7,Edgwired,the only one i use is flash

380,110208576,Edgwired,how long is 175 mm?
380,110208583.2,Other,less than a foot ... ~8-9 inches
380,110208612.5,Edgwired,and why do you want them?
380,110208623.4,Other,just one ... because the one i have ... is stripped out on the inside
380,110208639.8,Edgwired,what is it?
380,110208644.7,Other,crank arm ... the pedal attaches to one end
380,110208655,Edgwired,ok
380,110208661.7,Other,"the other end to the font gears,,"

380,110208905.1,Other,right ... http://bike.shimano.com/product_images/FC/ev_images/FC_M571_EV.pdf ... see how this last one does not have the piece of metal going towards teh other side? ... specifically... there is no perpendicular tube attached to part #8 on the last one

380,110208994.7,Other,"vs, the first schematic which has #8 with a tube"
380,110209004.8,Edgwired,the tube makes it what
380,110209009.5,Other,stronger ... lighter ... more durable ... less parts ... etc ... because in the case of the second version ... there is an entire part they build with bearings and shit packed into it that goes between #8 and #9
380,110209059.6,Edgwired,ah ... the difference is noticable?
380,110209081.2,Other,yeah ... superior design ... and i imagine that it will last longer ... and require less maintenance ... and eliminate the problem i have with the current model
380,110209121,Edgwired,which is the stripping?
380,110209128.8,Other,right
380,110209136.8,Edgwired,stripped because of lack of post
380,110209149.5,Other,which was caused by part #9 coming loose from the part which the post replaces
380,110209164.4,Edgwired,i see

394,110394687,Other,nada ... you? ... feelin the chicken still

394,110394700.8,Edgwired,that chicken was gooood ... lord
394,110394703.6,Other,felt i had to stay true
394,110394707.8,Edgwired,LOL ... can't find roxana ... but that's not a big deal
394,110394731.3,Other,might be at work
394,110394754.5,Edgwired,i've come to the conclusion that Jason doesn't know how to manage and I'm in the middle of writing an essay about it
394,110394783.6,Other,why
394,110394795.4,Edgwired,just to clear this awful way of communicating up
394,110394806.9,Other,we said to do the buttons that way
394,110394823.4,Edgwired,but nobody asked me why i didn't
394,110394831.4,Other,why
394,110394837.3,Edgwired,i'm copying you on the email ... it will be in there
394,110394841.1,Other,oh jeebus ... alright ... wel ... the main screen part makes sense to me ... the top bar is not part of the main screen ... yet it is fully light
394,110394883.2,Edgwired,just read the explanation ... when i send it to you
394,110394909,Other,i think we just need more communicating ... there is no back and forth
394,110394921.1,Edgwired,"well, you're gonna get a whole heaping helping of it here in a minute"
394,110394930.9,Other,wonderful
394,110394940.6,Edgwired,i want my wallet and my shorts
394,110394944,Other,ha ... sounds like fun ... adam liked your news.pdf
394,110395651.4,Edgwired,oh yeah?
394,110395653.9,Other,yeah ... should i print it full colour?
394,110395659.6,Edgwired,good to know ... i don't think that's necessary ... but ... if you like
394,110395681.1,Other,yeah.. i think bw is fine ... is it possible to have a css that treats different links differently ... on the same page
394,110396500.3,Edgwired,sure ... i think you just use a different definition for the links ... maybe you can use no definition for a: and then apply whatever you want to the actual links
394,110397465.2,Other,"yea,, i have to learn css better" ... it'll be less work in the end
394,110397567.7,Edgwired,i may quit this job
394,110397584.1,Other,ok.............. ... anything else?
394,110397634.7,Edgwired,i'm not trying to be funny ... i'm really disappointe
394,110397646.9,Other,with
394,110397652.6,Edgwired,having to say that ... at least accept the idea
394,110398249.1,Other,lol ... its a fucking presentation ... talk about dwelling
394,110398264.4,Edgwired,you wanted communication
394,110398267.3,Other,no ... i'm saying
394,110398269.3,Edgwired,that's communicating
394,110398271,Other,from jason
394,110398272.8,Edgwired,oh ... yeah ... did you get the second email ... ? ... the one just a few minutes ago?
394,110398292.4,Other,yeah ... all full of shit
394,110398301.6,Edgwired,some of it is reasonable ... some of it ... is like ... he's not even thinking about what he's saying
394,110398324.4,Other,he's most likely seeing red at this point
394,110398326.1,Edgwired,and saying it in such a way that i'm five year sold
394,110398332.9,Other,and tahts' why ... i know one thing
394,110398346.6,Edgwired,?
394,110398348.2,Other,all three of us have seen it too much ... and are therefore ocmpletely biased ... if you show it to gonzo ... he'd think it was absolutely fine ... and while I think there is the point that if we are in the business of simplification
394,110398392.8,Edgwired,"yes, he just said that offhand a few mintes ago"
394,110398394.5,Other,"and we can't convey a presentation in a simple cohesive manner," ... then it reflects poorly on our company ... however ... i do not think that the presentation is THAT bad at this point ... and usually i will nit-pick until there aren't any nits left
394,110398466.3,Edgwired,i thought the version that i sent you was presentable
394,110398466.5,Other,the presentation is quite effective and clear in its current state
394,110398475.2,Edgwired,a lot of what he's asking for ... is ... just ... overkill ... i don't know ... it doesn't bother me so much to put in if he really wants it
394,110398506.1,Other,the way this should work ... is we all should view it together ... comment as we go through ... stopping it and playing it
394,110398534.7,Edgwired,that what you and i did with that word file ... but look ... "Learning box - Do not show the help menu, only once it start pointing to the calendar, only the learning box should not be darkened - only the learning box should not be darkened; upon the presentation saying that ""SimpleC prompts you along the way"" the learning box should be enlarged with a focus upon the phrase ""Click Next"" this focus may be achieved by darkening everything except the click next phrase and the Next button."
394,110398551.8,Other,"outside of that, jason takes his side and feels like he has to get his way"
394,110398553.7,Edgwired,that right there ... is impossible to do ... literally ... the box falls off the screen ... and the next button isn't all there ... and he didn't even look at it ... and he's insisted on it three times ... i don't think i'm being unreasonable ... when i point stuff like that out ... some of the other stuff is negotiable ... like the step by step ... and i really don't think putting a mask over everything all the time is going to help overall ... but even that is something we can discuss ... but ... the demanding ... and getting angry over it ... is getting to be unreasonable for me ... it doesn't improve my day to have these kinds of discussions ... and it might not even be worth the experience
394,110398711.7,Other,it needs to be more of a discussion
394,110398713.6,Edgwired,of getting to learn more about this
394,110398721,Other,that's it
394,110398723.5,Edgwired,if we keep having to hate on each other
394,110398734,Other,i dunno ... i think he's probably frustrated/tired from his trip ... no excuse
394,110398752,Edgwired,nope ... sorry
394,110398757.7,Other,anyway
394,110398761.7,Edgwired,it's more than just this trip
394,110398767.2,Other,i know
394,110398767.4,Edgwired,it's classic bad management ... and i'm not blameless ... at ALL ... but ... i know when i'm being abuse ... d
394,110398844.8,Other,"when you don't do what is requested, supply a reason/logic" ... because it does come off as if you are simply disregarding/ignoring ... "on the other side of that coin... the recipient should ask ""why did you not do...."
394,110398915.1,Edgwired,"yeah, i mean, should i really write up a justification for every piece that i submit?" ... that seems excessive
394,110398931.4,Other,if you are specifically not completing a requested item ... and not necessarily write up ... but somehow ... explain why
394,110398958.7,Edgwired,it just took me two hours to write that email ... for four points
394,110398965.8,Other,right ... it woudl have taken 10 minuts ... to talk about ... maybe 25 ... with the presentation in hand ... i'm calling jason.... ... i don't even know where he is ... brb
394,110399026.2,Edgwired,k
394,110399200.5,Other,when can you come to philly next?
394,110399207.1,Edgwired,i'm in philly right now
394,110399210.6,Other,ahhh ... good times ... he's still in dc ... supposed to call me back shortly
394,110399245.5,Edgwired,i'm moving back into this city in a month
394,110399256.5,Other,"and, as i guessed.... has been dealing with complete incompetence"
394,110399268.9,Edgwired,listen ... i am anything but incompetent
394,110399280.3,Other,i know that ... but it's hard to transition between the two....... at least for him apparently ... cause he does have to list things out step by step for others ... holding their hands ... and then he tries to do that with you.. which does not apply
394,110399338.4,Edgwired,micromanaging is not going to work in his facor ... favor ... in any event
394,110399347.1,Other,sure ... but he has to do that ... with others ... its pathetic
394,110399362.9,Edgwired,that's an HR issue
394,110399366.3,Other,yeah
394,110399376.7,Edgwired,but really
394,110399386.2,Other,there's too much to do for too few people
394,110399386.4,Edgwired,i don't think it's as much of an HR issue as it is a psychological issue
394,110399400.7,Other,because the people who are doing TEA stuff ... are idiots
394,110399405.1,Edgwired,Ha
394,110399414.2,Other,and he's having to micro manage that shit
394,110399427.9,Edgwired,Dan. You know i will not be micromanaged
394,110399434.5,Other,i know this
394,110399436.4,Edgwired,ok
394,110399438.3,Other,i think that's a big part of it ... that he tries to ... cause he has to with them so much ... he just keeps on steamrollin ... and doesn't realize ... that he shouldn't ... and that it works against him ... wasting time/effort
394,110399491.4,Edgwired,this is really it though ... it has to change ... or business changes ... between us
394,110399509.7,Other,right
394,110399510.6,Edgwired,and really it's just business
394,110399544.3,Other,if someone were hired on a contract basis.... it might work better ... just giving them tasks ... if they were not responsible for original ideas
394,110399564.6,Edgwired,i think that's an amazingly bad idea ... given the way we delegate work ... and the way work gets processed ... no one would ever get paid ... for getting something done ... because ... "most things are never ""done" ... around here
394,110399620.4,Other,"right, either that, or we would pay 5 times for one thing"
394,110399625.1,Edgwired,right ... and you would end up with ... a very limited vision
394,110399662.9,Other,they don't realize this
394,110399663.9,Edgwired,believe me ... jason does NOT want to make the decisions that i make for him ... if he goes much farther upstream ... he's going to end up with shit on his desk ... of his own doing ... "i think it's reasonable to say that i'm a better artist than he is, and he has said it himself many times." ... so micromanaging my art with his vision ... ends up with the shitty vision ... that's logical ... right?
394,110399784.6,Other,but if he see's soemthing as open for improvement
394,110399790.1,Edgwired,fine
394,110399797.6,Other,such as emphasizing the buttons or whatever
394,110399810,Edgwired,he's not open to alternatives ... and when were into details like this ... and i keep saying this ... it's mostly arbitrary ... and really ... i'm supposed to be the one that makes the call ... over what's arbitrary
394,110399861.4,Other,i know that for me it makes it much clearer if only the button in question is light up
394,110399861.7,Edgwired,because i'm supposebly the professional in this regard ... and if you read my response ... i say that's fine
394,110399880.8,Other,on that specific issue... but i also understand the difficulty
394,110399898.1,Edgwired,but the technical issues outweighted the strength of clarity
394,110399902.4,Other,right
394,110399927.5,Edgwired,"ok, but i'm still getting taken to the mat for making that call"
394,110399952.2,Other,because you didn't explain at all ... you are half right
394,110399967.2,Edgwired,i didn't have the opportunity to explain ... there was no discussion ... there were no questions
394,110399975.8,Other,there was a request
394,110399983.4,Edgwired,and a response
394,110399985.1,Other,there was a submission which did not fulfill ... without explanation as to why ... then a reactionary reponse to the lack of fullfillment
394,110400017.3,Edgwired,if it were a verbal conversation
394,110400023.6,Other,it would have been smooth
394,110400030.4,Edgwired,a question would have followed ... if it were a verbal argument ... a reaction would have followed ... now ... we're having an argument ... instead of a conversation ... and i'm not the one ... that's caused it
394,110400124,Other,no ... he did ... the situation did ... whatever ... the solution is to tlak about it ... instead of shooting arrows
394,110400186.5,Edgwired,this is why i can't talk to sameer though ... it's the same pattern ... and if it's really going to be like that with jason ... then i'm only realizing it right now ... and it's not acceptable ... with sameer its acceptable because i never have to work with sameer ... with jason ... i'm sorry but i hate being dragged down into this kind of drama
394,110400416.3,Other,basically jason should have discussed instead of throwing it back ... end of discussion
394,110400450.9,Edgwired,ok
394,110400454.2,Other,right?
394,110400455.2,Edgwired,i'm going to to take a walk ... that's what i think
394,110400466.5,Other,do that
394,110400477.9,Edgwired,i'll be here until i get ahold of roxana
395,110400929,Other,call jason
396,110404488.8,Other,did you call jason
396,110404501,Edgwired,going to finish my snickers bar first
396,110404503.9,Other,lol ... do that ... you'll need the engergy ... i'm going to play squash with gzo
396,110404519.4,Edgwired,k
396,110404522.4,Other,take it out on the squash ball ... might be a sinking ship everyone should jump off of ... anyway.. i'm seeing red ... talk to you later
396,110404543,Edgwired,i'm not going to argue with him ... if he gets foolish with me ... i'm going to hang up ... and that will be it
396,110404568.9,Other,i think you would have been better to tell him why you didn't do what we requested when you submitted it ... that's the only thing i can say
396,110404589.8,Edgwired,ok
396,110404599.6,Other,i don't necessarily agree with either of you ... its a process problem ... whatever ... time to smack something ... i'll talk to you laters
397,110816188.4,Edgwired,howzit

408,112758164.4,Other,"by the way,,, ichat is the shit"

408,112758238.4,Other,this is the exact situation gzo and I were talking about ... he knows the back end ... i know the front end and overall project management ... etc
408,112758288,Edgwired,"yeah, developing web services for small business is definitely an underserved market at this moment" ... will last for maybe 5 more years ... decent money ... the strictly funny thing about all of this is ... that I think I'm doing this on a project basis ... managing it myself though ... incorporate as a consultancy ... pay no taxes ... live in tahiti ... once you develop one framework ... you can carbon copy it ... for a specific market ... like real estate ... revenue wise ... trick is to do it cheaply i guess ... because that's where the market will shake itself out ... "eh, maybe not" ... at least not right now ... "if you do it well, i bet you can charge an ass load" ... ok ... going to go beat jak and daxter #2 ... fun game
408,112758534,Other,on the phone with suaznne

410,114541287.4,Other,jesus H ... it finally worked
410,114541292.5,Edgwired,? ... ha ... what was the prob?
410,114541312.5,Other,the problem is that you can do this in any number of ways ... and i wanted to do it my way ... i have yet to completely grasp the best ways to work with flash ... "in terms of scenes, embedded movie clips, etc" ... but scenes was the final success route
410,114541368.1,Edgwired,ah ... are you going to leave it the way it is?
410,114541400.1,Other,leave what the way it is?

410,114541693,Edgwired,don't like the rotate
410,114541696.5,Other,yeah ... i didn't know how to get it from the middle to the corner ... a slide looks worse IMO ... any ideas?
410,114541724.7,Edgwired,flowers grow

411,114545025.6,Edgwired,i like the way it grows from the right ... the one in the center is odd ... shifts to the right
411,114545133,Other,that's odd ... after it comes to the foreground? ... or during its transition ... "also, do you notice any ""boxes"" around the images?"
411,114545684.2,Edgwired,no boxes
411,114545693.9,Other,werd
411,114545704,Edgwired,when it comes to the foreground it pushes the kappa farther than the sigma
411,114545722,Other,that's what your eyes tell you ... nevermind ... you're right ... the kappa is just wider
412,114558970.1,Edgwired,"yay, our wireless reaches to the train station" ... dude ... i'm getting hit on my 50 year old women ... decent looking
413,114628219.1,Other,how much money would someone have to pay you for you to let them puke in your mouth

413,114628303.5,Edgwired,"i figured in a $5,000 asshole tax" ... "$5,000,000, no question" ... do they have aids?

413,114628400.3,Edgwired,"$30,000,000 and a stomach pump"
413,114628646.7,Other,if you were in a pool up to your neck in puke and someone threw a bag of diarrhea at your face... would you duck?
413,114628681.6,Edgwired,"if you were in a pool of puke, you'd probably start to disintegrate"
413,114628689.5,Other,ok smartass ... from teh acid ... yeah ... but not that quick
413,114628705.2,Edgwired,quick enough to get out
413,114628711.4,Other,lol ... see. the thing i don't get with flash is what the best methods are for changing pages for example ... cause you could make a page a movieclip... or a frame... or a scene
413,114628995.8,Edgwired,personal preference
413,114629006.9,Other,does it not affect the size of the swf?
413,114629015.8,Edgwired,i've read things that acknowledge that the difference is small ... nah ... same objects ... diff ... code ... i think

413,114629754.3,Other,not sure how large to make this page ... i have it at 550 pixels now ... afraid that if i go to 725 or so... the swf will get to large
413,114629792.7,Edgwired,that's big enough
413,114629795.5,Other,suggestions? ... werd ... that's the default ... yeah ... even with my monitor on 1280X 1024 ... i see things fine ... flash is supposed to display the same on all browsers... correct?
413,114629965.6,Edgwired,yes
413,114629975.1,Other,that's what still gets me.. ... julian said that when he viewed the grey animation ... "that there were ""boxes"" around the graphics as they moved"
413,114630037.4,Edgwired,maybe the version of flash?
413,114630042.5,Other,maybe ... that's what i thought ... you saw the one with the menu rollovers.. right?
413,114630287.3,Edgwired,y

414,114704637.2,Edgwired,it's very business like day ... i'll be on the phone with accounts receivables all day ... i already had to basically tell off paula quietly ... for suggesting that i'm responsible for not knowing why this mess exists

414,114705977.6,Other,"it was weird, i tried to assign onOver and onRollOut behaviors to each rollover movie clip,,, but it would get all screwed up... so i had to put a button over each movie clip"
414,114706004.6,Edgwired,that's what i did for neocyde.net
414,114706046.6,Other,and then just used instances of the same movie clip.. right?

415,114714617.8,Edgwired,i just had this confrontation about vacation/sick days
415,114714627.4,Other,what about
415,114714639.6,Edgwired,"the fact that she was like, ""one week is standard" ... and it took me a WEEK to get her to say it
415,114714660.8,Other,are you on salary?
415,114714663.3,Edgwired,yes
415,114714671.9,Other,that's nice ... benefits?
415,114714675.6,Edgwired,"and she said ""we don't take sick days" ... benefits MAYBE after 6mo - 1 year
415,114714689.9,Other,"wait.. so if you get sick, it cuts into your vacation?"
415,114714697.5,Edgwired,i asked her that ... the real problem is that you can't nail her down on anything
415,114714712.1,Other,whatever
415,114714714.3,Edgwired,and these are pretty simple questions ... she said ... " people just make up the day" ... because i said ... i'm not taking a day of my week's vacation if i'm sick ... and really ... i'm insisting on two weeks ... "because for 25K, i'm getting two fucking weeks of vacation, i don't care what fucking industry it is" ... she said ... after 3 months we'll talk about it ... i think she feels like that even talking about it is annoying ... or ... presumptive ... and i'm like ... listen
415,114715056.7,Other,dude ... she just doesn't want to give away the bank ... on the first day ... work with her for a while ... ease into it ... if she's still stubborn about it in a month ... then you have a problem ... you have a legitimate point ... she knows that ... but doesn't know how to handle the situation ... she's intimidated by the fact that you have a legitimate point.. you know it... and you are smart enough to out-negotiate her on it
415,114715385.7,Edgwired,"i tried to tell her that me going to business school was going to work out for her in the long run, but she's definitely not used to dealing with it"
415,114715422.3,Other,you mean having gone to b-school?
415,114715542.1,Edgwired,right
415,114715547.1,Other,right ... "she's smart enough to agree tho,,, right?"
415,114715563.8,Edgwired,she really doesn't have any conception of how bad her books are ... in her own way ... she really work like i was trying to work with Jason ... "like ""everything will work itself out" ... "instead of ""lets do this methodically"
415,114715592.5,Other,eyah ... that doesn't work out so well
415,114715601.9,Edgwired,ha
415,114715607.2,Other,in certain areas
415,114715616.7,Edgwired,we worked it out ... i told her it has to be this way for a while ... because if i'm not superorganized ... it's not going to ever become automated
415,114715642.3,Other,exactly ... "sounds like a situation where things need to be ""laid out" ... like... listen here lady... you may not know this... but i'm the best thing to come your way in a long time ... and you're trying to shaft me over like i'm a regular idiot ... "which, obviously , i am not" ... but i know that you don't want to give everything away... I just want a reasonable situation for both of us ... blah blah blah
415,114715796.6,Edgwired,EXACTLy ... that's what i said ... it has to be mutual ... or i'm going to get frustrated ... and we both don't want that
415,114715841.8,Other,right ... you'd leave ... "which, would set her back, yet again" ... kerning isn't showing up when i preview
415,114715978.6,Edgwired,no idea ... could be a bug
415,114716132.4,Other,"if i were to make it reverse, do you think it should reverse while the new one comes out, or sequentially.. reverse, then come out"
415,114716237.9,Edgwired,um ... quicker is better ... in most cases
415,114716249.9,Other,yeah
415,114716250.4,Edgwired,for a menu
415,114716251.6,Other,same time ... i don't think the reversing out will work so well ... because what would i do with the sub menu while the new submenu comes out
415,114716363.6,Edgwired,that can just go away
415,114716379.4,Other,and have the menu items moving at the same time
415,114716385.5,Edgwired,y
416,114722829.4,Other,how far are you into actionscript in terms of controlling movieclips and such
416,114723231.2,Edgwired,not very ... ?
416,114723267.2,Other,playing ... trying to get this shit to work out like i want ... there are so many tutorials out there ... but they are limited in scope ... they tell you how to do one specific thing ... "and, of course, i always want to do it my way"

434,116441891.6,Other,oh ... you can do taht with a separate piece of software ... VNC ... I have that capability ... but i can only watch the other person's machine as they use it ... due to fucking bullshit ass restrictions ... as if i'm going to break the machine or something ... "but yeah, i can spy on the guy i work with" ... although it is pretty apparent when you machine starts to lag ... "oh, and i was trying to import wma, not wav" ... so i think i'm outta luck in that department

434,116442331.2,Other,you can ... not with this tho ... but you can't complain about this.. since it's free ... but I guess you can complain about anything

460,118589948.6,Edgwired,i can't get used to them
460,118589959.9,Other,and the option to click and drag a line to bend it ... i like the interface better than using the points in fireworks
460,118589990.6,Edgwired,"yeah, i see that" ... "you can import stuff from illustrator, but i'm not sure it retains the vectors"

460,118590131.5,Other,that's weak
460,118590139.6,Edgwired,a bit
460,118590140.1,Other,i find that it just doesn't cover all my needs ... and i hate the fact that explorer is even on my machine
460,118590158,Edgwired,why not firefox?
460,118590159.5,Other,but it works when i need it to ... eh ... laziness ... so i guess the hate hasnt built up enough yet

461,118610235.6,Other,haha ... i figured out how to make a password protected section of the site ... and the password is pulled from a text file
461,118610261.5,Edgwired,http://www.aairpass.com/christmasbook/
461,118610270.2,Other,so all they have to do is change one word in a text file
461,118610275.7,Edgwired,not useful ... i'm headed over to sign some due diligence for jason zamer
461,118610291.9,Other,what?
461,118610304.9,Edgwired,apparently he needs my signature on something
461,118610308.4,Other,ha
461,118610311.7,Edgwired,so he can get his investment
461,118610319.8,Other,that's odd
461,118610333.7,Edgwired,i think it was just a missed form ... he thought the first options would cover the second
461,118610353.2,Other,got it
461,118610356.8,Edgwired,ok
461,118610359,Other,laters

462,118625499.3,Other,kewl ... we're definitely going to kill ourselves
462,118625522.1,Edgwired,more likely than not ... "The energy from colliding positrons and antielectrons ""is 10 billion times ... that of high explosive," ... awesome
462,118625551.7,Other,yeah ... i'll take a rain check on that demo day ... oh.. i got password functionality hooked up
462,118625576.4,Edgwired,we could test it on the moon and fuck up all the tides
462,118625588.3,Other,with a dynamic text file that hold's the password. ... ha ... yeah... that'd be great... tidal waves
462,118625618.4,Edgwired,that's not exactly secure?
462,118625628.3,Other,of course not ... they aren't housing information on antimatter bombs ... they just want to look cool ... "if I hid the directory the text file is in, it would be ok" ... i'm not even blacking out the password
462,118625678.7,Edgwired,"Smith is looking to store positrons in a quasi-stable form called positronium. A positronium ""atom"" (as physicists dub it) consists of an electron and antielectron, orbiting each other. Normally these two particles would quickly collide and self-annihilate within a fraction of a second -- but by manipulating electrical and magnetic fields in their vicinity, Smith hopes to make positronium atoms last much longer." ... that sounds like a disaster waiting to happen
462,118625703.2,Other,yeah
462,118625826.8,Edgwired,so you have to have a password to get into what section?
462,118625833.3,Other,lol ... "a section that says."" you've entered the password protected portion of this site"
462,118625852.9,Edgwired,http://www.dansdata.com/kitten.htm ... "is there going to be anything there?"
462,118625891.1,Other,who knows ... i told them to get me something if they wanted ... but we'll see ... suzanne is going to love that webpage
462,118626061.7,Edgwired,"Clearly, and despite competing opinions, a kitten is substantially preferable to a puppy. It's also, incidentally, obvious that a new video card is 1.5 times as desirable as a baby." ... shit ... "Clearly, and despite competing opinions, a kitten is substantially preferable to a puppy. It's also, incidentally, obvious that a new video card is 1.5 times as desirable as a baby."
462,118626096.4,Other,haha
463,118698276.6,Edgwired,what was that site that suzanne pulled the recipe from?

465,119452373.5,Other,it was written from their national account
465,119452378.2,Edgwired,god GOD

465,119452625.6,Edgwired,*cashed*

465,119453375.8,Other,one of those moments when you think that maybe the world isn't going down the tubes all that fast ... of course ... it was pathetic ... they would come up and just slap me around ... then break my neck

465,119453583.3,Other,i was thinking the same thing
465,119453583.8,Edgwired,now that could be fun
465,119453606.3,Other,those goggles are tough enough to take the beating too
465,119453607.6,Edgwired,"that's what we'll spend out extra $10,000 on"
465,119453626.4,Other,people would pay money to do that

465,119453776.8,Edgwired,nah ... you'd get up to $500 ... by the end of the night ... if you had some really sick paramilitary gear ... you could make a lot more per person ... but less overall ... prob

465,119453831.2,Edgwired,yes
465,119453871.3,Other,"although, at that point, people who have that much money to throw around, they pay for the convenience of having someone else maintain it all"
465,119453890.7,Edgwired,they could buy it from you and keep it at your place
465,119453927.8,Other,probably something you'd have to do a lot of developing events/missions/scenarios ... dude
465,119453940.3,Edgwired,?
465,119453947.2,Other,we should get into the high-end adventure business ... like play it all out ... fly them to a location in a helicopter ... etc

481,120000152.7,Edgwired,these aren't widescreen
481,120000160,Other,the 20 is or is not

481,120000167.5,Other,right...

481,120000233,Other,i do ... i have like 3 pair ... but new ones are always welcome

481,120000250.4,Other,last year's model ... my newest are like 4 years old ... at least ... so funny ... i found all his completed auctions ... and it's the same list as he's selling on newsgroups
481,120000296.8,Edgwired,is he trying to sell them for a profit?
481,120000302.1,Other,yeah ... he paid 280 ... 30 shipping... so 310 ... asking 400 ... "Hey, You just forgot to tell me that it has NO bindings (you must pay for them + mounting) and that there are still another 19hs!!! to go... I'd wait until it is closed...Then again, it is your call.Cheers, Pablo" ... "~$300 is the appropriate price for this ski (used, bindings mounted), but I get it, you need to make a profit on the ski's you bought off ebay. Makes much more sense now. I'd suggest changing your ebay username if you are planning to continue this business model. Then again, it is your call. -DB"
481,120000349.7,Edgwired,you're never going to get those skis
481,120000353.6,Other,right ... at this point i really don't care ... they are too short for me anyway ... it would be just for shits n giggles that i woudl email him that response

488,120095353.1,Other,yeah ... oh.. you have to read his response ... "Dear Dan, For your reference, this ski is never sold below 350+ on ebay (and that's before, shipping). There is where I got the price from (and I was going to be flexible on that as well). Here I am sending you two (fresh) links, from eBay, for your reference (both before shipping): http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=7107661707&ssPageName=STRK:MEWA:IT http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=21246&item=7108212803&rd=1 I was just offering our used skis to see if, eventually, we can change my wife's and my own gear. I do not know where you get your allegations of a business from, and you threatening me is nothing I would take lightly. I am not forcing you to buy from me, so I do not understand what's wrong with you. Good luck finding your skis, and take life a little easier, and do not go around falsely accusing people. Cheers, Pablo"

497,120676082.7,Edgwired,qubit@neocyde.net ... back ... thanks for sending it ... i'm maybe the worst sales person on the face of the earth
497,120676226.8,Other,right
497,120676256,Edgwired,i like the company
497,120676269.6,Other,said salary wasn't based on sales for that position ... dunno ... didn't really read it too much... just thought to send to youi
497,120676292.8,Edgwired,i appreciate that a lot ... i'm going to send something to them
497,120676333,Other,good deal
497,120676359.4,Edgwired,might have to hook up some splinter cell after maria leaves
497,120676382.3,Other,aight ... sounds good
497,120676404.3,Edgwired,i got the combination lock instead of the key one ... i wonder if that was smart
497,120676439.3,Other,you mean like one that screws on the outside of door and door jamb?
497,120676516.2,Edgwired,"oh, nah, the cord for my powerbook"
497,120676520,Other,oh ... got it ... i thought you were jjust going to bring it over here?
497,120676562.7,Edgwired,everything but ... i'm going to tie it down to the post in my armoire ... so i have options with the music ... esp late late
497,120676593.8,Other,got it ... your costume makes suzanne sick
497,120679250,Edgwired,ha ... literally?
497,120679266.8,Other,"how would he feel if one of his friends was raped..." ... "is he looking to offend people?"
497,120679284.3,Edgwired,tell her it's halloween and it's supposed to be scary ... what scares adults? ... rape
497,120679318.5,Other,she says she's gonna go as Matthew Shepard
497,120679323.7,Edgwired,neat
497,120679329.9,Other,lol
497,120679345.6,Edgwired,i'm going to leave that one alone
497,120679367.2,Other,yeah ... she's all worked up now ... jeebus
497,120679386.5,Edgwired,i expect some of this at the party ... "whenever somebody launches into it, i'm going to walk up to them and say ""Boo."
497,120679488.4,Other,yeah ... i dunno
497,120679588.4,Edgwired,"what's more, nobody will ever forget what costume i had on"
497,120679612.9,Other,i guess ... i'd be afraid of someone getting reallly pissed ... cause 1 in 4 women has been
497,120679695.5,Edgwired,i'm expecting it ... that's half the fun ... "much, much better than getting no reaction at all" ... it's the perfect idea
497,120679757.7,Other,aight ... i think i agree with suzanne on this one to tell you the truth ... i don't even think she's coming now
497,120679905,Edgwired,you think you could possible talk me out of it?
497,120679912.1,Other,no ... not at all ... "well, maybe... but i think you're too stubborn to be talked out of anything" ... and it really isn't my place
497,120680006,Edgwired,at least now i know it works
497,120680010.9,Other,yeah ... if that's what you're going for
497,120680024,Edgwired,there will be all kinds of reactions ... tedi's friends all laughed
497,120680033.4,Other,right
497,120680723.4,Edgwired,"it could be the worst idea in the history of bad ideas, but even that makes it worth doing" ... is she really not coming?
497,120681972.8,Other,prob not
497,120681980.6,Edgwired,you too?
497,120681989.5,Other,who knows
497,120682000.6,Edgwired,does she want to talk about it?
497,120682009.2,Other,i'm gonna say no ... she's upset with me at the moment ... not related to halloween.. i've just been bugging her and she needs to get work done ... "regarding the costume, i think it would probably make her uncomfortable regardless of any talking about it"
497,120682119.7,Edgwired,i think it might help if she at least understood why i decided to do it
497,120682144.5,Other,i don't know if that's true ... "it's the fact that other people will see it and have their ""reactions"", and that it is inevitable that it trivializes the crime/victim" ... "you, as the wearer, cannot prevent that from happening"
497,120682205.7,Edgwired,i disagree. i think it's cause for discussion of something serious
497,120682212.8,Other,at a party? ... i don't think it's an appropriate forum
497,120682267.5,Edgwired,yeah it probably does trivialize it. ... i guess i'm not bothered by that ... the artistic statement behind it is powerful ... rape is trivialized by the evening news ... it's social commentary
497,120682548,Other,the evening news is not dressing up in a costume at a party ... they are reporting the events
497,120682568.7,Edgwired,nah ... they're selling soap ... put this in context ... it's a halloween party ... it's not a costume ball ... at a costume ball it would be completely inappropriate ... but the point of halloween is to celebrate everything that's wrong with culture
497,120682618.3,Other,put it in this context ... if a girl is at your party ... and there is someone dressed as rape ... "and people are laughing at it, regardless of whether or not their laughter is rooted in discomfort, ignorance, immaturity" ... it will inevitably make that girl uncomfortable ... it's your party ... you can do whatever you want ... i'm not saying anything against that ... just don't expect everyone to think it's appropriate ... and do expect people to be repulsed by it ... not like ewww... that's gross repulsed... ... "more like, what kind of mind thinks that is even close to OK, how is it possible that all these people are standing here thinking that it's OK"
497,120682860.6,Edgwired,the kind of person you're describing is both judgemental and insecure ... and that's not the type of person i cater to
497,120682887.2,Other,ok ... "i don't think anyone should be ""secure"" with the topic of rape"
497,120682911.8,Edgwired,i do ... certainly
497,120682918.9,Other,that's ridiculous
497,120682922.6,Edgwired,"no, it isn't" ... fear of the issue is what causes it to happen
497,120682960.5,Other,respect for those who have endured it and have to deal with it on a daily basis ... if i had been raped ... and i saw someone dressed as rape ... at a party ... i really want you to explain to me how you are going to come up to me and tell me everything is ok
497,120683052.4,Edgwired,such a person has to face that fear and be able to deny it
497,120683058.1,Other,fear?
497,120683059.8,Edgwired,to ever be ok ... yeah
497,120683077.8,Other,one should never be ok with rape
497,120683078.8,Edgwired,the fear of the act happening again
497,120683090.6,Other,there are other issues
497,120683094,Edgwired,i'm not trying to justify rape
497,120683102.9,Other,just mock it
497,120683103.8,Edgwired,that's deifnitely not the point
497,120683112.6,Other,and even if it isn't YOUR point to mock it
497,120683122.4,Edgwired,"yeah, put it in a box and make it abstract"
497,120683126.1,Other,the fact that there is an entire party of people around you accepting it does ... "and you're tellin me that as a hypothetical rape victim, i'm supposed to be ok with that"
497,120683176.8,Edgwired,"yes. i'm telling you that if you are ever going to be a whole person, you have to"
497,120683206.9,Other,i'll be ok with people discriminating blacks and gays and all that too ... we'll all be ok with it ... and accept it ... and set the stage to resume those practicies
497,120683232.7,Edgwired,LOL ... now that's a little bit far
497,120683250.1,Other,mind ... social acceptance ... that's where all those are rooted
497,120683270.2,Edgwired,nobody is going to think it's ok to rape someone because i wore this halloween costume ... and
497,120683282,Other,i'm not saying they will
497,120683289.5,Edgwired,making fun of blacks and gays is exactly what halloween is about
497,120683298.5,Other,victims
497,120683308,Edgwired,halloween is about terror ... or ... being the instrument of violence ... or making victims ... it works on SO MANY LEVELS ... halloween is how children lose their fear of all the things that scare them. so why is that wrong for adults?
497,120683473.8,Other,"yes, if you isolate your angle... that works" ... "but there are other angles which, in my mind, make it innappropriate" ... and that's why it is YOUR party
497,120683521.7,Edgwired,"dude, i KNOW it's inappropriate." ... but that's the point!
497,120683551.1,Other,i just think that telling someone to not take rape seriously is fucked up ... "and essentially, that is what you have to do in order to go to a party where someone is dressed up as rape"
497,120683628.2,Edgwired,i don't think you're taking rape seriously enough if you're limited to that point of view ... i'm taking it dead serious
497,120683639.2,Other,i don't think many people are actually going to think about the issue when they see it ... it isn't a question of how you are going to view yourself
497,120683661.4,Edgwired,sure it is
497,120683665.5,Other,it is a question of how others will
497,120683669.1,Edgwired,exactly!
497,120683673.6,Other,right
497,120683677.1,Edgwired,who will get it? ... i don't know ... but even if five people out of 150 people get it ... then the idea is a success ... because it's communicated on the deepest levels
497,120683713.1,Other,regardless of the 145 you offend
497,120683719.4,Edgwired,definitely ... that's what art is ... or at least one very important aspect of it ... for example: ... http://www.wetterlinggallery.com/archive/nathalia/nathalia_main.htm ... "Most people who see Nathalia's pictures for the first time are impressed by how beautiful they are. It takes a few seconds before you start to wonder how they have been made. A photo-montage? Some kind of digital manipulation? When you look closer, there is something slightly distorted in the rabbit's expression. Something slightly abnormal about the face of the cat. Slowly you realise that the animal is dead, that the animal has died for the sake of the picture. Is this acceptable? One can, of course, choose to think that it is always wrong to kill animals in the name of art. That nothing can defend Nathalia Edenmont. But if you feel more doubtful, we would very much like to explain Nathalia's reasoning, and how we at Wetterling Gallery argue when we exhibit her art. Art arouses thoughts and poses questions that are necessary. Nathalia's beautiful pictures are frightening in the same way that many other beautiful things hide some sort of suffering. One can enjoy beautiful exteriors, or one can go beneath the surface and find things that perhaps you do not want to know about. If Nathalia's pictures had been repugnant, it would have been easy to reject them. But now they are so beautiful - and the insight into the reality behind them gives rise to thoughts about people's shallowness and double standards. Many of us eat meat, wear leather or use make-up that has been tested on animals, without this arousing especially strong reactions. But when a picture shows a dead rabbit, all hell breaks loose. Nathalia grew up in the former Soviet Union, and she has a razor sharp eye for paradoxes and gaps in our western morals. She is not the first to use dead animals in her works of art - that has been done at least since the 1700s, but she is a contemporary debater who provokes questions which nowadays everyone should ask themselves. Her pictures tell lies in front of our faces, but they are not alone in this - the lies exist all around us every day, without us questioning them. There is nothing illegal in Nathalia's art. She has killed the animals in as humane a way as possible. Has she been guilty of a moral crime? We do not think so. We think that art is of vital importance." ...

497,120683874.3,Other,reading ... on the webpage now ... i get it ... i don't expect people to be comfortable with it ... and I don't know why one would go to a party where they were uncomfortable ... doesn't sound like a good time
497,120684167.3,Edgwired,the type of people who i want at my party are people who will be ok with it ... even if they think it's distasteful
497,120684178.4,Other,aight
497,120684480.4,Edgwired,"if maria and al and imri get pissed off about it, i'll just go as a housewife"
497,120684504.1,Other,go as what you want
497,120684519.8,Edgwired,"nah, the party is all of ours" ... even though i'd enjoy being a problem ... i'm not going out of my way to annoy them ... "i think if anyone won't be ok with it, it will be al" ... i'll ask him what he thinks ... it's still a brilliant costume
497,120685498.5,Other,"well, let me know if you change your costume"
497,120685503,Edgwired,ha
497,120685514,Other,seriously
497,120685519.6,Edgwired,i know ... i just think it's funny
497,120685530.2,Other,i probably would too ... if it didn't seriously affect me
497,120685778.6,Edgwired,you can tell suzanne that i think hating on someone's creativity is pretty criminal
497,120685787.1,Other,i'll not ... she isn't hating on it anyway... just doesn't want to be at the party
497,120687343.8,Edgwired,"i'll go as matthew shepard""?"
497,120687348.7,Other,haha
497,120687360.2,Edgwired,mocking my creativity
497,120687415.3,Other,seems valid to me ... par
497,120687448.4,Edgwired,"nah, her intention is different"
497,120687470,Other,"she was making a good point, in my opinion" ... i thought it was a great example to put it in another perspective ... same as if i went as a black slave ... or a KKK member
497,120687532.1,Edgwired,i think all of those are valid halloween costumes
497,120687539.4,Other,aight
497,120687540.8,Edgwired,i think trying to be moral about halloween is pretty ridiculous
497,120687541.7,Other,and that's fine ... that's fine too ... we're free to do all that
497,120687569.1,Edgwired,LOL ... yeah
497,120687590.8,Other,nobody told you not to do whatever you want
497,120687638.2,Edgwired,"nah, you just made it three times harder to pull off"
497,120687650.9,Other,i did nothing of the sort
497,120687670.5,Edgwired,sure ... you did ... "to pull something like this off, you have to own the idea" ... and casting doubt all over it makes it harder to pull off
497,120687734.2,Other,"if anything, i made it easier" ... cause you justified it to probably the toughest critic ... already ... believe me... you own it
497,120687768.3,Edgwired,LOL ... "yeah, i'm tempted to do it now out of spite"
497,120687788.7,Other,that's fine too ... really ... personally i just don't give a shit ... when it comes down to it ... i'd go either way
497,120687837.8,Edgwired,and for my second act i'll be playing the party of Joey Ramone
497,120687848.9,Other,"do i think it's appropriate, not really,, but that's just my opinion, and it wouldn't stop me from going" ... i dont' even know who joey ramone is ... didn't know who matthew shepard was
497,120687884.6,Edgwired,that's more the angle i'm going for ... tolerance ... joey ramone was the front man for the quintessential punk bank ... band
497,120687922.2,Other,"dude,,, i get the experiement part of it" ... i get the artistic expression ... "and if it were not for this conversation, i wouldn't have given it much thought at all" ... "but, when i started to think about it,,, I didn't agree with it" ... that's all
497,120688114.2,Edgwired,i just cannot get past the fact that that very reaction is the most raw expression of exactly what a scary fucking halloween costume is all about.
497,120688147.2,Other,halloween started as a celebration of the dead
497,120688158,Edgwired,almost right ... halloween is a celebration of demons ... all-saints day is the day that follows
497,120688264.5,Other,all-souls day ... another related day
497,120688408.6,Edgwired,some dude is IMing me in italian
497,120688428.2,Other,why
497,120688436.7,Edgwired,he wants a copy of I Robot in Divx ... i have no idea where he got my nic
497,120688459,Other,werd ... weird
497,120688464.2,Edgwired,very ... esp since i don't speak a word
497,120688473.5,Other,see what he thinks of your costume ... ;)
497,120688483.3,Edgwired,i posted a topic on the forum ... i really wanted it to be a total surprise
497,120688491.1,Other,dude ... you should have
497,120688495,Edgwired,but now i've got to take a poll
497,120688497.7,Other,fuck that
497,120688500.9,Edgwired,i haven't told anyone what it's going to be ... just that it's controversial
497,120688524.4,Other,"right,,, that doesn't accurately get the point accross tho" ... "whatever,,," ... bottom line... just let me know what you decide
497,120688572.7,Edgwired,i think Al's gonna balk
497,120688585.4,Other,i wonder why
497,120688593.8,Edgwired," Of course, there is such a thing as an inappropriate costume.Plenty of things are sacred, until they are belittled by human neglegence.Halloween is not a day meant to celebrate everything that is wrong with our culture. �Thanksgiving is more along those lines. ... imri is totally fine with it ... ok ... i'm doing it ... nobody seems to mind
497,120696134.3,Other,ok
498,120710048.5,Other,any idea where i can get monkey ears?
498,120710070,Edgwired,the halloween store on columbus blvd maybe ... tonight it was a zoo
498,120710081.6,Other,i bet ... all i need is to go to the i goldberg and get some patches ... then i need monkey ears and tail
498,120710142,Edgwired,also the philadelphia zoo ... they have a big monkey thing i think
498,120710225.2,Other,gotcha

499,120750964.5,Edgwired,I've been talking about this for at least five years. This is the first article where I've seen anybody do anything realistic. ... I wish I had been able to do it ... fuckers are going to make a whole hell of a lot of money
499,120750999.2,Other,yep

536,123014538.4,Edgwired,yeah
536,123014539.7,Other,and then the other day i went over to your house and was talking to her about suzanne ... which was good for me ... i needed to talk to someone ... and it was good of maria to do that for me ... but again... ... sorta felt guilty ... cause i'm yelling at her in my head
536,123014579.7,Edgwired,hba ... don't feel guilty about it ... she is definitely a partner in that feeling ... that same day ... that you came over ... i went upstairs to see how she was doing ... and we were talking in the bathroom ... and i picked up her brush ...

536,123014844.7,Edgwired,yeah
536,123014844.8,Other,and you get frustrated that you are wasting your time
536,123014852.6,Edgwired,oh i've definitely wasted a lot of time ... but up to now ... i didn't mind even a little bit ... because it was just Maria ... being stupid ... but now ... she's different
536,123014884.1,Other,it's an ongoing characteristic

542,123690461.4,Edgwired,sure ... he's on iChat
542,123690485.8,Other,what is his sn
542,123690512.8,Edgwired,uh ... mjefree23
543,123690549.9,Edgwired,"he wants Jules', but i don't know what it is" ... i gave him yours already

543,123690855.5,Edgwired,http://www.popgadget.net/2004/12/business-card-cutter.html
543,123690877,Other,haha ... ha ... where did that come from?
543,123691470.5,Edgwired,eyebeam
543,123691478,Other,? ... i need your help deciding on a phone....
543,123691519.5,Edgwired,?
543,123691526.2,Other,i already ordered the motorola V551 ... but it is on back order ... i am considering switching to either the Nokia 6230 or Motorola V180 or V220
543,123691563.1,Edgwired,link me
543,123691576,Other,http://www3.letstalk.com/product/promo.htm?depId=1&pgId=100&mid= ... http://www3.letstalk.com/product/promo.htm?depId=1&pgId=100&mt=&tNav=1&showNoProductsMessage=0&nc=&mid=#offers ... use the 2nd one
543,123691601.3,Edgwired,keeps asking me for my zip code
543,123691606.3,Other,ahhh ... put it in then
543,123691620.4,Edgwired,here we go
543,123691624.1,Other,then choose cingular as your carrier ... then select different phone... and it will pop up a window with all of the phones
543,123691854.8,Edgwired,i'd wait for the one your ordered
543,123691869,Other,yeah... i was initially going to get the nokia ... but i think the one I ordered is a better deal
543,123691892.8,Edgwired,are you really going to do it through this site?
543,123691895.1,Other,the only advantage of the nokia is upgradable memory ... "yeah, why not"
543,123691901.7,Edgwired,i dunno ... but if you do ... i want to know how it goes
543,123691914,Other,everything went fine so far ... just got off the phone with customer service ... very easy and helpful ... no problems if i wanted to change the phone ... quick ... i figured.... Nokia links to them from their site... ... can't be that bad ... so... anyway.. we'll see ... she said they were expecting the phones yesterday
543,123692013.9,Edgwired,oh ... yeah ... i'd wait
543,123692033.5,Other,it's a decent phone from what i can tell.. ... the v220 was cheap ... v180 felt better ... nokia was sorta flimsy on the keys ... i went to cingular to test them out day before yesterday ... i think the only thing missing on the v551 as compared to the nokia is mp3 and FM capability
543,123692124.9,Edgwired,and bluetooth
543,123692127.8,Other,no ... v551 has bluetooth
543,123692136.9,Edgwired,oh ... sorry ... i read it the other way
543,123692165.2,Other,so anyway.... we'll see how it goes ... thanks for you input

543,123692192.7,Other,phones are fucking expensive these days
543,123692208.6,Edgwired,very
543,123692333.5,Other,the hot shit is.... ... "through lets talk, i only had to sign up for a year of cingular" ... and the final phone price is $29.99 ... "through cingular,,, it would have been 2 years and final phone price of $99.99"
543,123692386.5,Edgwired,i want to know what the catch is ... can you get insurance on the phone?
543,123692403.5,Other,"not completely sure, but don't see why not" ... my understanding is that you can insure basically any phone
543,123692425.8,Edgwired,and who administeres your cingular account?
543,123692434.7,Other,cingular
543,123692448.7,Edgwired,so you can add other services later?
543,123692460.9,Other,sure... ... all you have to do to recieve the mail in $50 rebate is send letstalk a copy of your second bill ... "so, after the second month... you could do whatever you want to the account"
543,123692536.2,Edgwired,ok ... let me ask you something
543,123692578.5,Other,k
543,123692581.4,Edgwired,the assistant of the loan officer that i'm working with at Commerce is a real fucking bitch ... they lost my paperwork over a week and a half ago
543,123692594.1,Other,damn
543,123692596,Edgwired,and every time i try to get information out of her ... or get her to do something ... she feeds me this ration of bullshit ... instead of being helpful ... i've been trying to be nice to the loan officer ... even though she isn't the one that makes the decision ... because she's the one that supposed to be on my team ... but ... they definitely aren't acting like they're on my team ... and every time i call i get pissed off ... wondering how much leeway i should give this girl
543,123692700.5,Other,in terms of?
543,123692702.6,Edgwired,how much shit i should eat ... getting the fucking thing processed ... last night ... at 4:45 ... "Anne tells me that she's lost my paperwork and that if i fax it to her by 5:30 she'll get it over to the department that processes it " ... "first thing in the morning" ... so i can have an answer this afternoon ... "at 5:15, after I've faxed some bullshit copy i had with a bunch of scratched out numbers" ... I call and get her assistant Michelle ... "who says that ""a lot of papers come through this office" ... and when i MAKE her go pull it off the fax machine and put it on Anne's desk ... "Michelle says that ""Anne will review it in the morning and blah blah" ... "Now," ... I just called over to their office ... and get Michelle ... who says Anne isn't even IN yet ... and that she doesn't know when she'll be in ... that she's assured me that my papers are on her desk
543,123692870.6,Other,how much are you applying for?
543,123692873.3,Edgwired,but hasn't volunteered to help me in any fucking way ... "18,000" ... in getting the stupid papers faxed over ... she's really pissing me off ... because ... she acts like ... i'm the problem
543,123692910,Other,sounds like both of these people are worthless ... anyone above them?
543,123692917.6,Edgwired,i don't know ... but i do know ... that if they don't get this done today ... i'm going to find out
543,123692929.9,Other,yeah ... write all this shit down ... make calls ... find out who you need to send this stuff to
543,123692958.8,Edgwired,even though i still need the loan? ... i mean
543,123692962.5,Other,like... a lettter of disgust
543,123692968.4,Edgwired,when i first started with this ... she was like ... Oh Sure ... send your paperwork in ... by 3 ... and we can have an answer for you by the next day ... and if you're approved
543,123692993.1,Other,why don't you apply elsewhere?
543,123692995.7,Edgwired,we can finish your paperwork in a week
543,123693004.2,Other,try another branch ... or bank
543,123693007,Edgwired,because every other time i've dealt with commerce ... they've been super awesome ... i got my ATM card back from them yesterday in like 15 minutes ... plus ... both me and my dad bank there
543,123693039.3,Other,yeah ... put that in the letter ... can you deal with another loan officer ... ?
543,123693056.5,Edgwired,i'm wondering who to ask ... i may go by my branch today ... and ask
543,123693067.5,Other,definitely ... just do that ... where is this branch you are dealing with?
543,123693093.7,Edgwired,Anne is in the corporate office over on Market Street ... which makes me wonder if there is a different one ... i got her name from a friend of mine who is the branch manager of Society Hill
543,123693139.8,Other,"so, this anne character is the end all be all of loans?" ... i don't get the advantage of dealing with her
543,123693147.8,Edgwired,she might be ... the only one that i had was that she was a contact of Bobbys ... but they're really fucking up on me ... and i really think Michelle is being rude
543,123693186.6,Other,"well, ask your friend" ... see what kind of information you can get ... about the process and if you could/should go to another branch ... "I mean, it's really stupid of them to screw you around like this"
543,123693237.9,Edgwired,i'll wait and see what happens today ... for real it is
543,123693545.1,Other,btw... i didn't really like the razr in person

543,123693762.3,Other,right ... i'm just sayig ... $30 ... versus $400 ... is huge
543,123693781.1,Edgwired,nah ... not over the course of a year
543,123693794.9,Other,and in a year... i'll drop $400 on a phone that is worth it ... $400 will get me to colorado and back 1.5 times
543,123693815.7,Edgwired,what's going to be different in a year?
543,123693834.5,Other,improved everything ... camera resolution ... less wide
543,123693846,Edgwired,that's a false argument
543,123693850.8,Other,larger exterior screen
543,123693852.1,Edgwired,that's like saying ... i'm going to wait to buy my powerbook in a year ... and waiting for three years ... i did that with the ipod ... and you know what? ... they came out with what i wanted after four years ... i need a phone now
543,123693903.4,Other,right... and you could have bought a mp3 player for $50 ... in the meantime
543,123693912.1,Edgwired,nope ... that's worthless
543,123693925.4,Other,not at all
543,123693927.6,Edgwired,spending an extra 50 ... on a poor user experience
543,123693938.6,Other,haha ... well ... i need the functionality of a phone ... now ... the v551 serves that purpose
543,123693990.3,Edgwired,you're buying a PC all over again ... you won't get a new phone in a year ... and you know it
543,123694021.6,Other,dude ... think about it ... i have $30 attachment to this phone ... you think i give a shit about $30 over the course of 12 months? ... i don't give a shit about $30 over the course of this afternoon ... "clearly, in a year, if they make the razr better" ... i'll be all over it ... right now i don't value 1 dimension that much ... .35 inches of depth is not worth $370 to me
543,123694161.9,Edgwired,it is to me
543,123694163.8,Other,werd ... are you going to insure your phone?

548,123950957.7,Other,39.99 national ... so. 450 anytime rollover minutes ... 5000 night and weekend ... free mobile to mobile ... the thing is.... you pay for text messaging ... "which, i'm not so so worried about..." ... but fyi
548,123951030.6,Edgwired,do you know how many minutes you were using before
548,123951067.3,Other,like 300 a month of my anytime ... and maybe 1000 of night and weekend???? ... maybe
548,123951088.8,Edgwired,hmmm ... i have no idea how much i use ... what a fucking great idea that was ... getting people to try to figure out how much they use the phone in order to pay for it ... you're too low ... you're fucked ... too high ... fucked ... way too low ... way too fucked
548,123951168.7,Other,eh ... i just pay my $40 and call it even
548,123951191.1,Edgwired,maria had an $800 phone bill
548,123951208.6,Other,well ... one does have to be reasonable ... wasn't that cause of dropped calls?
548,123951236.8,Edgwired,yes
548,123951238.7,Other,i still don't get it tho ... if you know you are having a problem ... you should probably monitor its effects
548,123951287.7,Edgwired,i don't think anybody can reasonably expect an $800 phone bill ... that's extortion
548,123951322.9,Other,sure... i'm just saying there had to be signs
548,123951377.5,Edgwired,have you ever heard of anything else where you pay for a service and then pay 20 times more because that service is broken?
548,123951409.3,Other,i don't know the details of the situation ... no i have not ... but there has to be something to it ... any carrier i have ever been with has always removed dropped calls ... and what i'm saying is.... ... to rack up $800 ... that has to be a lot of dropped calls
548,123951472.7,Edgwired,yup
548,123951477.5,Other,so ... one had ample warning ... the problem didn't surface from nowhere
548,123951526.3,Edgwired,well they stuck it to her
548,123951528.8,Other,yes ... sounds like it
548,123951548,Edgwired,"anyway, i don' t know which plan i should get"
548,123951580.4,Other,what details are you contemplating? ... nationwide/regional?
548,123951599.8,Edgwired,nationwide
548,123951612.9,Other,are you contemplating more minutes than the $40?
548,123951619.6,Edgwired,probably ... i thought the 850 plan might work ... might be way too much too
548,123951684.5,Other,and you are thinking of the nationwide to cover your trips to TN?
548,123951711,Edgwired,i just hate the idea of roaming
548,123951738,Other,"right,,, but you can look at the map and determine if you actually need nationwide"
548,123951764.8,Edgwired,how much does it save you?\
548,123951777.3,Other,$40 would get you 600 min ... and unlimited nights/weekends
548,123951790.6,Edgwired,no rollover
548,123951807,Other,yes ... rollover ... wait ... still 5000 night and weekend ... shit ... nevermind ... and $9.99 for mobile to mobile ... screw that
548,123951848.7,Edgwired,yeah
548,123951871.9,Other,might as well do the $50 and get the 600 anytime if that is what you want ... how much do you use your phone?
548,123951896.8,Edgwired,"not much, but that's b/c i hated it" ... would use it more for long distance ... and i really wish they had a better data plan
548,123951973.4,Other,so you could use your phone to surf the internet?
548,123951986.6,Edgwired,"yeah, mapquest when i'm on the road"
548,123952005.4,Other,ah

548,123952628.1,Other,pretty neat
548,123952683.4,Edgwired,so i think i'm going to have to find a different loan officer at commerce bank
548,123952692.9,Other,i'd say so
548,123952717.1,Edgwired,"would you a) write a nasty letter to the original, useless loan officer and copy customer service OR b) not write a nasty letter to the original, useless loan officer and copy customer service"
548,123952776.6,Other,i'd not write a letter ... that's not going to get you a loan ... "but i *would* use the ""oh so terrible experience and poor customer service"" when talking to your next loan officer" ... i think that's the only way you can use it to your advantage
548,123952860.8,Edgwired,how to find? ... i'm thinking i have to call customer service to get a new name
548,123953131.7,Other,prob ... call them anywy ... they are there to help you ... you want money ... you have a legitimate gripe ... they are there for both ... would it be a personal or business loan? ... are you going to incorporate?
548,123953380.9,Edgwired,should i?
548,123953385.2,Other,yes ... i'm thinking that should be your first step
548,123953449.1,Edgwired,before the loan
548,123953505.2,Other,well ... you can't get a business loan if you have no business
548,123953531.9,Edgwired,we're using the numbers from my father's business
548,123953537.3,Other,ah
548,123953541.8,Edgwired,and his federal tax id
548,123953554.4,Other,"ok, so the loan is under his business"

548,123953575.8,Other,do you know you can apply for this online? ... you use commerce right?

548,123953818.1,Edgwired,probably from cherry hill
548,123953847.1,Other,I think you can play off the poor treatment you have received thus far ... to at least speed things up ... and get better service this time
548,123953871.6,Edgwired,i'm going to call and find out if the app just gets forwarded to the woman i've already been using ... today's probably not a good day to call

"basically I have two options 1. buy applecare for $47, extending the warranty for another year... and covering any shipping costs/etc. 2. buying my own battery and replacing it myself for $30 + shipping"

697,124212785.5,Other,who the fuck has that much going on that they can't remember it on their own

697,124212801.7,Other,"if you've got that much going on, get a secretary"
697,124212803.5,Edgwired,that's why we have assistants
697,124212816.9,Other,the phone thing could be possible ... someone was claiming that phone based mp3 players could be the most serious competitior to the ipod in the future ... "and that's all fine and whatnot, but i want a ps3 NOW" ... http://engadget.com/entry/1234000113023000/
697,124212986.4,Edgwired,Apple experimented with WiFi iPods over three years ago

"why not build a walkman to tune into the streaming web radio stations that do the same thing as the satellite fuck faces, without the satellite and subscription part?"
697,124213435.6,Edgwired,conceivably a PDA would do that
697,124213441.4,Other,yup
697,124213449.4,Edgwired,or an iPod

758,100744431.3,Edgwired,i bet ... did you know who was calling?
758,100744436.2,Other,scARY ... no ... I thought it was Verizon ... so I said ... HELOO!?! ... all mad because I was having an issue with them ... and I hear ...

758,100744648.7,Edgwired,right ... that's weird
758,100744667.1,Other,it is wierd ... but i also realized that my respect for him was always characterized by what others thought of him ... and i can't worry about that anymore ... I used to feel guilty if I talked to him ... all the more reason to treat him like a secret addiction

758,100744759.3,Other,yup yup ... i'm fine trust me ... still have the old impulses around him ... but getting better...

758,100744877.6,Other,but i'm also not worried about hurting teddy ... well that's the bad part ... I said ... "what's your problem, TR?" ... and he said ... "well, I've already found the solution" ... "don't worry ""beautiful" ... blah blah blah ... so he was trying to obviously lay it on thick ... and I said ... "truss me," ... "I AIN""T NOBODY'S SOLUTION" ... Caroline
758,100745026.1,Edgwired,whoa ... so...
758,100745033.1,Other,he said ... "aw, don't hate me" ... "and I said, u know I could never" ... "but we can't ever go back, TR. NEver." ... "Now I can talk to you, but only as a FRIEND" ... and if that's not enough ... hang up ... and he said (after some silence) ... I gotta go ... but I'm gonna keep on trying
758,100745112.6,Edgwired,so he wants to get back together with you again?
758,100745116,Other,no

758,100745130.5,Other,he gets the same hankering I do ... we pine for each other ... it happens every march/feb ... but this time I had to resist ... because I can't go thru it again
758,100745174.5,Edgwired,good choice ... i don't like him so much
758,100745192.5,Other,no no ... no one does ... only me ... only I see the light ... but I'm not resisting for you ... "or for Dan, or Tedi or whoever" ... but for me ... but I can honestly say ... I've never loved anyone like that ... no one does it to me like he does ... it's CRAZY

You talk a good game from the 27th to 29th, partly because you're so convincing and partly because you mean every word. Your waiting is over by the 31st, whether your intended says yes or you find someone even better." ... :-/

807,107104384,Other,"so I said, I'm surprised at you Wes" ... I thought you were smarter than that ... ! ... and walked downstairs ... leaving him in his underwear ... "(and of course, I looked gorgeous)"

I am falling for you ... and I know you are falling for me ... but it's not my feelings are not your responsibility ... I mean my feelings aren't your responsibility ... just as you ... can't hold me responsible ... IF YOU WON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO FEEL YOURS ... :-o
807,107104700.8,Edgwired,"here is your mirror, go stare at it for a while"
807,107104726.7,Other,TOUGH huh?
807,107104738.3,Edgwired,did he have a response?
807,107104747.8,Other,deflections ... kept saying ... silly shit ... but he did say ... but the thing is ... I am falling for you know ... now ... but I might be falling for Misa in a month ... :( ... I dunno mikee ... I don't think I can love this man ... there are too many obstacles ... he has terrible addictions ... and he loves them
807,107104819.1,Edgwired,yeah
807,107104826,Other,and he doesn't want to be completely open ... he's scared
807,107104847.7,Edgwired,"i think it is good to do for the sex and attention, but i really don't think you're going to enjoy dragging him out of his headspace"
807,107104855.6,Other,no ... it's not even that I won't only enjoy it ... it's not possible ... while I could definitely rock Wes' world ... he wants Misa because she is prolly funny ... and smart ... but as he told me ... she's a pothead ... he wants someone with just as much honesty as he's willing to take ... and I am too much for him ... ! ... I AM SO FUCKING CONCETED
807,107104945.6,Edgwired,no ... darling ... that gets right to the point of it ... you are definitely too much for him ... he's afraid his head is going to break open
807,107104971,Other,as long as I remember this ... your right
807,107104988.3,Edgwired,and fitting everything you tell him inside of it at once ... scares the shit out of him
807,107105005.7,Other,right
807,107105011.8,Edgwired,"the words i'm concerned with are , ""i might... in a month" ... what kind of bullshit is that
807,107105016.7,Other,but my heart will still be broken ... I know ... he wants to love this girl
807,107105028.2,Edgwired,so
807,107105033.7,Other,so what babe? ... he's committed to her
807,107105039.3,Edgwired,i'm saying
807,107105046.7,Other,he needs to hold on to those things ... he thinks that is BOND ... u know?
807,107105059.7,Edgwired,ha
807,107105077.9,Other,he hasn't had his Tedi relationship ... he's only had his TR ... get it?
807,107105090,Edgwired,i'm saying recognize him for what he really is right now and how that is NOT what you want or need or would fulfill you and keep your heart intact
807,107105114.3,Other,the mind understands that ... but perhaps the greatest mystery of our being is that the mind speaks a different language than the heart ... :-/
807,107105141.2,Edgwired,and we tend to follow the heart
807,107105146.2,Other,sniff
807,107105150.8,Edgwired,well
807,107105161.5,Other,I'm gonna be fine now ... don't you worry
807,107105167.2,Edgwired,it's basically impossible not to love a person like that because you know the potential
807,107105174.5,Other,right ... but ... I think Wes doesn't want to go there ... it's not even a possibility ... in some ways he's a hypocrit ... u know?
807,107105230.4,Edgwired,"yeah, he knows better i think" ... choosing to remain a child ... when he knows he's a man
807,107105264.4,Other,he's still the fat kid ... hiding ... behind drugs alcohol ... his cat ... his fear
807,107105299.6,Edgwired,i think maybe he wasn't as afraid before ... and let himself slide into it
807,107105311,Other,his last relationship? ... or when we first met?
807,107105318.9,Edgwired,before that
807,107105326,Other,OH I SEE ... that makes sense ... we slide into these things ... as we get older ... gotcha
807,107105357.7,Edgwired,"yeah, Bowling for Columbine syndrome"

807,107105475.9,Edgwired,"you are superior to her in many, many ways, the LEASST of which is your physical beauty"
807,107105486.6,Other,Thank you ... I just want to say you are superior to everyone in EVERY WAY ALL THE DAMN TIME ... :D
807,107105513.2,Edgwired,meh ... what's the second question
807,107105518.1,Other,swear it ... oh ... do you find it interesting that he MIGHT see her in a month? ... that she hasn't set the date yet? ... what's with that?
807,107105562.5,Edgwired,that's a tougher one ... if it were me ... it wouldn't suprise me because we operate on instinct ... but it's not me ... and if it's really that uncertain ... up to the fates to decide whether it happens
807,107105594.6,Other,"what you mean, instinct?"
807,107105601.4,Edgwired,probably means it's not that set even if she DOES come
807,107105601.8,Other,you mean she'll come when its time
807,107105607.8,Edgwired,that's what i would do ... but ... i'm not so sure that's what's happening
807,107105615.2,Other,"he sees it as set, babe" ... seriously ... he says that at least to me
807,107105634.5,Edgwired,thing is
807,107105636,Other,hmmmm
807,107105640.9,Edgwired,would it really be that much of a struggle ... if it was an intended thing?
807,107105657.6,Other,yes I see that ... but wes wants a human to cuddle with ... not his cat anymore ... so he's going to find a female feline ... who'll cuddle up with him when he's wasted ... and just purrrr
807,107105712.1,Edgwired,and he's going to upend this poor girl from TEXAS to have it?
807,107105713,Other,he's so everywhere ... YES
807,107105719.9,Edgwired,if she wants to move here
807,107105725.4,Other,he thinks this is it
807,107105727.4,Edgwired,she should fucking move here of her own accord
807,107105729.1,Other,I swear ... I think he wants to marry this girl ... deep down
807,107105749.1,Edgwired,MEH
807,107105767.1,Other,so boring ... I wish I could talk to Ian about this ... but I don't think that's fair

807,107105865.4,Other,yes?
807,107105874,Edgwired,in the absence of Misa the situation would be exactly the same ... she is only a very small part of his fear
807,107105883.6,Other,TRUE ... the situation is not what I am frustrated with ... it's my lack of a REAL chance ... because of SOME TOOFY GIRL
807,107105917.5,Edgwired,haha

809,107224466.9,Edgwired,was it nice?
809,107224476.3,Other,but he told wes that you must face conflict ... because otherwise it can land you on your face ... rather than your back ... or something ... and then he said ... with irony ... often enemies ... will become great friends ... ;)
809,107224547.6,Edgwired,"There is an old Chinese proverb that reads, ""In every gain, there is a loss and in every loss there's a gain"" Fear is like that. Even the most brave fear something. Weights and balances, my friend. Fearing conflict is really the worse, though. Your others are just trivial things. Specifics that heal, like everything else, with time. But conflict, fearing conflict is the most debilitating of fears because it leaves you in a constant state of retreat. I write you this now really because a very good friend of mine shared in your phobia, and then one day, he simply dropped off. It really hurt me, and in some ways still lingers, because I never knew the reason why. And when we are left to our own devices to solve something that we simply cannot solve, then one's fear of a temperate conflict leaves another with lasting scars. All I am saying is don't fear conflict. Avoiding the situation brings greater suffering, and makes it last. You only go through this passage of life as this entity once, so why hide from it? Chase your windmills, motherfucka! -Don Q." ... that?
809,107224598.1,Other,yup ... but wes must have looked up his name ... because ... he said on the phone ... how does teddy spell his name ... and i said tedi? ... why? ... but tedi had already told me that he wrote him ... I SMELL RAIN! ... YESSSSSS!

827,108434267.7,Edgwired,hey ... that means you have real time off ... what a novelty
827,108434307.6,Other,no ... I have three meetings tomorrow ... <sigh> ... are u going to key west?
827,108434334.6,Edgwired,no ... i cancelled all my trips
827,108434355.8,Other,meow ... :( ... y?
827,108434389.5,Edgwired,too much up in the air ... i need a cushion ... in some respect
827,108434420.1,Other,cushion for the pushin?!
827,108434425.4,Edgwired,i wish
827,108434485.3,Other,do you need sweet lovin? ... :( ... i need sweet chocolate!
827,108434518.3,Edgwired,i'd rather have a trust fund
827,108434523,Other,bitch ... this is your achilies heeel ... it pops up everynow and then
827,108434565.3,Edgwired,eh ... actually i haven't been thinking about it specifically ... only the general lack of options
827,108434601.7,Other,or the lack of general POSITIVE PERCEPTION
827,108434614.3,Edgwired,nope ... i can be happy with what i have and have few options
827,108434684.2,Other,hmmmm ... i am thinking NO ... but only thou knows thyself
827,108434707.5,Edgwired,"generally, a very significant part of my days are spent in very ideal situations" ... just not much changing ... probably for lack to true desire to change much
827,108434744.2,Other,you're ... comfortable ... some of the very same things that apply to me and tedi ... apply to you and this situation.... ... i think ... not trying to judge ... :F
827,108434904.2,Edgwired,"there's nothing to affect a change with yet, so i'm not that concerned about missing an opportunity"
827,108434995.7,Other,that wasn't the problem with me and tedi ... :-/
827,108435052.1,Edgwired,and yet when it finally adjusted you have several options to present themselves of their own accord
827,108435119.9,Other,not everything presents itself ... its is cultivated
827,108435177.4,Edgwired,"so far, cultivation has been a highly subconscious process for me"
827,108435250.6,Other,there is a world around u ... you lack of acknowledgement ... is incompatible with your desires for material comfort
827,108435330.9,Edgwired,"on the contrary, my lack of acknowledgement has led to a great deal of material comfort" ... what i lack is emotional comfort
827,108435353.4,Other,dissertate please ... ...
827,108435537.9,Edgwired,"how many people do you know that perform their workday in such places as the bath, the bed, a hammock, or under the shade of an umbrella? what's more, how many people do you know that travel at to far end of the earth? with some of the finest equipment and clothes available? at their own leisure? all *without* paying a great deal of attention to what most people consider their main concerns."
827,108435560.1,Other,material concerns=not monetary ... material concerns=expectations of others ... contradicted with your own ... #NAME? ... and self loathing
827,108435612.8,Edgwired,i don't know anyone that isn't self loathing ... "in fact, i happen to believe it's a very basic characteristic of existence" ... or at least consciousness
827,108435675.9,Other,u are wounded by the smiling slaves ... and the workplace is a place of ... vulnerability for you ... please accept my apology if I am being too forward ... :-/
827,108435773.5,Edgwired,the vulnerability in that respect affords me comforts in others that i wanted for a very long time
827,108435792.8,Other,must keep moving ... no?
827,108435815.6,Edgwired,we haven't seen anything to move to yet ... full circle
827,108435897.6,Other,u and I are not in the same mind fram ... e ... for once I am thinking in a very Junging ... Jungian ... Freudian way ... u are thinking my usual ... Buddha
827,108435973.8,Edgwired,"i'm more satisfied now with my ability to make decisions than i have ever been before, and that method of making decisions involves intuiting out the best options, and up to now i haven't felt many viable options, and it's more of an observation than an anxiety that such things happen to be this way"
827,108435992,Other,but practice of decision making should extend into your own matters ... all of them no? ... practice...action....balance
827,108436097.6,Edgwired,knowing when not to force a decision is often more important than affecting lateral movement
827,108436138.6,Other,knowing when to fashion the outcome is better than claiming detachment ... often comes as lazy when it mixes with certain situations
827,108436269.8,Edgwired,"eh, most of my best experiences were fashioned under the pressures of doing nothing"
827,108436297.6,Other,you're confusing terms ... fashioning unequal to presssure ... fashioning USING pressure
827,108436374,Edgwired,i'm not sure our statements differ
827,108436408.6,Other,fashioned under the pressures of doing nothing ... denotes to me ... subsisting under conditions ... ashioning USING pressure ... denotes using the force to one's advantage ... actively
827,108436473.7,Edgwired,doing nothing creates the pressures with which to fashion ... the world externalizes into extremes ... which bring upon action ... "my point is, i'm not under the extreme of anything" ... at this moment ... i have nothing to act upon
827,108436591.9,Other,ok then ... shall we question connotations ... of subsisting ... and EXisting ... I think u are CHOSING THIS: ... i have nothing to act upon
827,108436703.9,Edgwired,qualified: i have nothing to act upon which improves my quality of existence ... and so what if i choose that? ... it would take something major to improve at this point
827,108436759.9,Other,how so? ... I would argue the emotional ... and why ... don't u have the major in u? ... u have been given months of meditation
827,108436857.6,Edgwired,and i find that i'm well placed ... i just finished the major ... quite literally
827,108436876.3,Other,ok ... ok ... then u are completely complacent ... [in a positive way] ... with your situation?
827,108436968.7,Edgwired,"if life changed little for the foreseeable future, then i can be quite satisfied with it, which isn't to say that if it changed quite a lot, i wouldn't be satisfied it" ... i lead a good life
827,108436996.6,Other,yes
827,108436998.1,Edgwired,that's all i'm saying
827,108437035.7,Other,well ... I am saying ... u are a great person ... and u deserve to fashion your world as u see it ... but I think its impossible ... sometimes ... because u hide ... I think u are afraid sometimes ... to put your practice into your understanding
827,108437098.5,Edgwired,hiding doesn't change the experience one bit ... it comes and finds me
827,108437108,Other,I dunno ... I disagree ... mebbe I am just being selfish
827,108437169.9,Edgwired,you and tedi and wes are a great example of how my inexpression of relationship manifested into the necessity to deal with every side of the issue at once
827,108437180.4,Other,be more concrete
827,108437181.4,Edgwired,and i don't necessarily prefer either experience
827,108437182.8,Other,I am tired ... no ... but those aren't YOUR relationships
827,108437205.5,Edgwired,nope
827,108437209,Other,see my frustration at your trepidation
827,108437218.4,Edgwired,i get to contextualize the issues without being emotionally attached ... and yet ... still face the same conclusions
827,108437237.3,Other,but mikee ... we are human beings ... u can't love and get hurt and gain strength ... vicariously ... all in all ... u can't hide in the garden forever ... and still complain
827,108437282,Edgwired,who is complaining?
827,108437282,Other,that u want more ... mmmm ... ok
827,108437303.2,Edgwired,this garden has open walls ... it grows on its own
827,108437315.3,Other,ok
827,108437316.2,Edgwired,eventually everything may be included
827,108437322,Other,sure ... I think you're afraid ... sorry
827,108437347.6,Edgwired,i don't understand what you think i'm afraid of
827,108437368.5,Other,then forget it
827,108437388.1,Edgwired,"i have already done more, and seen more, and thought more, and created more than just about anyone i know"
827,108437402.1,Other,that's not the point ... I think you're afraid to go and get what u want ... and you're defensiveness proves it
827,108437455.6,Edgwired,i have more of what i want now than i have ever had ... i get what i want ... i'm not afraid to get it
827,108437471.3,Other,ok ok ... I disagree
827,108437501.7,Edgwired,my biggest fear ... "is that at any point i already have everything i want, and won't acknowledge that to be true" ... "but that is the fear that creates everything else, good and bad, and right now i'm willing to live with it" ... "as far as going out and getting what i want, i have very little fear of creating experience" ... i went to tn and got on a motorcycle ... last best example ... of me being motivated
827,108437621.8,Other,amazing of u ... I agree ... but what about your independence
827,108437636.9,Edgwired,"so, what of it that nothing else like that strikes my fancy"
827,108437646.8,Other,life is boring
827,108437652.4,Edgwired,life is simple ... not boring ... my life is definitely not boring ... i could sit in my back yard and look at chipmunks
827,108437675.8,Other,ok
827,108437676.6,Edgwired,and i would be quite satisfied
827,108437680.4,Other,I disagree ... :F ... u want to smack me up side the head
827,108437699.8,Edgwired,no ... i just don't think you're giving me a lot of credit
827,108437711,Other,OH MY ... NO ... I am only hard on u because I have been shown so many phenomenal things ... and I expect more... ... :P
827,108437769.8,Edgwired,"i get peace right now, and that's what i want" ... i've fought enough wars to enjoy it
827,108437820.2,Other,I feel the same way ... and I am most happy for you ... but remember that ... when u want the job ... the apartment ... the boyfriend ... "not without the good fight, lover" ... not without the good fight.
827,108437868.3,Edgwired,i'm retired ... haha
827,108437877.6,Other,BORING ... COP OUT ... FEAR
827,108437887.9,Edgwired,no ... my darling ... not fear ... age
827,108438047.6,Other,ok ... so u and your grandmom are peers ... ? ... u have old balls ... that's so pretentious mikee

Listen to the structure behind a piece and think about how you might write an algorithm to create that structure. Once you start writing the code you'll start to get more ideas based upon it, so that the eventual music sounds nothing like what you found inspiration from."

890,116989276,Edgwired,ahh ... small world
890,116989288.5,Other,yup ... :P
890,116989296.9,Edgwired,what you doin?
890,116989312.9,Other,crying
890,116989379.1,Edgwired,WHY
890,116989389.6,Other,I feel like ... I try to help everyone ... and I should just hide in a hole ... because I do no good
890,116989416.1,Edgwired,um ... that's a difficult reaction to have
890,116989435.2,Other,lol ... wes wants to go back to school
890,116989457.6,Edgwired,so i hear
890,116989461.7,Other,but he doesn't want to hear any opinion on it
890,116989469.4,Edgwired,i can understand why
890,116989469.5,Other,I have to smile and hold my tongue ... why? ... he says ... I don't want to be poor ... and then in the next breath says ... I want to go back to school
890,116989552.3,Edgwired,it's probably a very fragile arrangement he has in his head ... why do you feel the need to comment?
890,116989570.2,Other,I didn't actually want to talk about it ... he kept pressing the matter ... I walked away ... but he kept saying ... you're so negative ... you're so negative ... and I'm not ... I'm just tired today ... I don't want to talk ... I don't want to fight ... I don't have a good opinion right now ... but he kept pressing
890,116989667.6,Edgwired,is he still here?
890,116989673.5,Other,of course not ... he always leaves ... but that wasn't necessarily a bad idea
890,116989716.4,Edgwired,i don't think so ... he's been here since sunday
890,116989744.2,Other,I just hate when he leaves on a bad note ... it hurts my head
890,116989813.1,Edgwired,my advice is pretty thin
890,116989824,Other,I don't need any ... I just need to be cut some slack sometimes
890,116989845.1,Edgwired,you're the only person who can do that
890,116989845.2,Other,wes is hard on me ... y do I have to be presented with everything all the time ... and respond positively
890,116989883.8,Edgwired,you don't have to respond positively
890,116989891.1,Other,right?
890,116989898.2,Edgwired,you choose to
890,116989899.9,Other,I mean when I tell you certain things
890,116989900.6,Edgwired,same way
890,116989909.6,Other,you don't always say ... GO FOR IT
890,116989917.3,Edgwired,you can choose to take things seriously or cut yourself some slack and not
890,116989922.1,Other,and I understand ... I mean ... he changes his mind so much ... last weekend ... he talked about opening a restaurant ... this weekend ... its school
890,116989964.1,Edgwired,ok ... that bothers you?
890,116989974.3,Other,its confusing
890,116989980.5,Edgwired,you're taking him too seriously
890,116989989.2,Other,um ... ok
890,116990018.1,Edgwired,if you know he changes his mind regularly ... see what floats to the top and see what settles ... and don't drive yourself nuts by trying to filter it yourself
890,116990089.2,Other,ok ... I just hate it ... when he says I don't support him ... because I feel like I really do ... and he doesn't appreciate all I do for him
890,116990161.4,Edgwired,"again, your perception" ... you're torturing yourself ... maybe it's not communicated well enough between you to be recognized mutually
890,116990248.2,Other,ok ... I see ... and it scares me ... because I don't think I am a negative person ... I HATE being called that
890,116990311.2,Edgwired,maybe that's why you hear it a lot?
890,116990411.5,Other,because I don't want to be ... or because I am
890,116990436.6,Edgwired,ha
890,116990445.8,Other,what? ... am I? ... I am horrible. ... see?

890,116990471.1,Other,:'(
890,116990471.9,Edgwired,now that's some negativity ... i honestly don't believe ... that there's a wide variation of negative to positive between individuals within their lifetimes ... deciding which side of the fence you sit on is an immediate process and something that only the individual has perspective on ... someone's negative is someone else's positive
890,116990560.9,Other,oh? ... that makes me feel a little better ... what're you doin? ... I wanted to go out
890,116990866.6,Edgwired,farting up a storm

I just wish I had a bit of help ... at the important time

899,118182290,Edgwired,i'm just checking
899,118182298.9,Other,I was a little surprised
899,118182301.6,Edgwired,it was a weird situation
899,118182311.6,Other,and I was suprised that Imri knew
899,118182316.4,Edgwired,ha ... he knew that we hooked up?
899,118182330.3,Other,yup
899,118182333.4,Edgwired,interesting
899,118182341.1,Other,he said there was some freaky shit ... but he didn't care ... I was more surprised ... but you know I'm far from judgemental ... when it comes to you
899,118182380.6,Edgwired,i've been judging myself ... well not really ... but ... i really rode it off the rails
899,118182393.5,Other,I just thought the girl was ... unactractive
899,118182400.3,Edgwired,ha ... i know ... in a way ... yes ... in a way ... not at all
899,118182413.8,Other,hmmm
899,118182414.1,Edgwired,her mind is amazing
899,118182419.9,Other,the question is ... did u have fun?
899,118182433.4,Edgwired,wow ... tough question
899,118182440.6,Other,oh ... because if the answer was yes ... then the subject's over ... apparently you have the issue ... not i ... ;)
899,118182473.8,Edgwired,just the whole weekend ... was out of control
899,118182480,Other,oh
899,118182485.6,Edgwired,i feel really shitty about kissing wes
899,118182486.7,Other,so what? ... !?! ... why?
899,118182498.8,Edgwired,because that's WAY over the line ... that's like
899,118182503.6,Other,to you?
899,118182508.3,Edgwired,not something you want to do to your straight friends
899,118182516.5,Other,I don't think you should talk to me about that then...
899,118182518.6,Edgwired,because they shouldn't have to consider the possibility
899,118182526.7,Other,cause I never gave it a thought ... hey ... I smooched joey ... several times
899,118182595.6,Edgwired,it's like riding the lighting ... i really feel like i grabbed hold with both hands ... and killed summer
899,118182612.8,Other,wow ... "ok then, robert frost" ... :-/
899,118182631.3,Edgwired,"it's the drugs, m'dear"
899,118182635.4,Other,oh ... I get it ... except for the last part
899,118182646,Edgwired,ha
899,118182650.2,Other,killd summer
899,118182655.3,Edgwired,summer is dead ... as of this weekend ... like ... you build up
899,118182664.7,Other,oh
899,118182667.1,Edgwired,and keep building
899,118182668,Other,I gotcha
899,118182670.7,Edgwired,until it overloads
899,118182674,Other,I feel like summer's been dead
899,118182675.7,Edgwired,and then in decline ... i guess i missed the memo
899,118182703.3,Other,no ... it's purely internal ... but the solstice was on the 21st ... of sept ... :)
899,118182749.8,Edgwired,"anyway, we're going to rein it in a little" ... thanks for talking to me ... i love you
899,118182788,Other,i love you too ... thanks for talking to you?
899,118182799.3,Edgwired,yeah
899,118182805,Other,ummm...k... ... that's a strange comment ... but ok ... you're welcome
899,118182819.8,Edgwired,i'm just grateful ... at this moment
899,118182830.7,Other,sure Peshe ... hair
899,118182840.3,Edgwired,HAAARRREEE ... yay for conan
899,118182895.4,Other,thanks ... mikee ... I am really confused
899,118182914.1,Edgwired,over?
899,118182926.7,Other,my mind is crazy ... as soon as I told joey I couldn't see him anymore ... I missd him more than ever
899,118182954.2,Edgwired,that's not out of the ordinary
899,118182959.4,Other,and I was a total bitch to wes
899,118182968.1,Edgwired,you want to know my opinion?
899,118182972.9,Other,go ahead ... if you have the enrgy
899,118183032.4,Edgwired,"i think either he and/or you is making a mistake by trying to avoid each other. no matter what the dynamic, you're surpressing energy that's everntually going to manifest itself one way or the other"
899,118183098.1,Other,so fuck it ... and just let it go
899,118183141.3,Edgwired,"yeah, i think trying to do it any other way is useless torture"
899,118183152.4,Other,but cheating on wes? ... that can't happen
899,118183159.2,Edgwired,ok ... there are several many ways to see that it doesn't ... and i think the option you each want to choose out of the best of intentions is the most difficult one to maintain
899,118183212.6,Other,I agree ... but discipline brings better reward ... we reap what we sow
899,118183256,Edgwired,"as long as you're not cutting yourself off from all the options, that's true" ... "i think if you were more willing to consider the possibility that wes and joey could operate in different roles in your life, you'd be less drawn to changing the roles they have now"
899,118183317.4,Other,hmm ... explain that more conretely ... please
899,118183338.7,Edgwired,you remove the temptation by accepting its consequence ... and then ... energy flows ... without the blockage ... dangerous advice ... because you're surrendering in a way ... putting it up to faith ... "if wes, then wes" ... "if joey, then joey"
899,118183411,Other,wow ... ok
899,118183414.4,Edgwired,"if wes, not joey is what's holding you"
899,118183435.2,Other,but what if I'm just flowing to joey because he gives me the attention i like
899,118183442.8,Edgwired,totally possible ... and i think it's a pretty valid observation ... "does not matter though, does it?"
899,118183479.5,Other,nope ... I just don't want to be overly selfish ... all motives are selfish
899,118183503.2,Edgwired,i don't think you can avoid it
899,118183503.5,Other,but I don't want to fuck with someone
899,118183507,Edgwired,well ... that's the only thing you have control over
899,118183517.3,Other,myself ... I know ... but I don't ... I kissed him ... and I don't twant to lead him one ... on
899,118183553.4,Edgwired,i think you're afraid of losing what you have
899,118183558.4,Other,yes! ... of course i am
899,118183599.6,Edgwired,"worst case scenerio: wes finds out, joey doesn't enter into a new relationship"
899,118183613.1,Other,that's not the worst case at all ... I don't want a new relationship
899,118183632,Edgwired,i wonder if that's honest
899,118183635.4,Other,it is
899,118183653.9,Edgwired,ok
899,118183654.3,Other,i just want to have fun with whomever I'm with
899,118183657.3,Edgwired,that may be honest
899,118183660.6,Other,no more taking to the family ... no more visting the family ... no more sleeping over all the time
899,118183683.4,Edgwired,but here's the deal:
899,118183688,Other,?
899,118183703.4,Edgwired,"if you're not willing to accept having two relationships, then wes needs to know about joey"
899,118183708.4,Other,he does ... I told him yesterday ... no Monday ... no yesterday ... sorry
899,118183726.6,Edgwired,heh ... :F ... good ... the hard part is over
899,118183742.3,Other,u know I couldn't do tha ... t ... I mean he doesn't know all of my feelings ... but he knows I am tempted ... and he knows I kissed Joey ... but he tried to convince me it was out of sympathy ... and I disagreed
899,118183788.2,Edgwired,tried to convince himself
899,118183794.7,Other,maybe ... he doesn't seem scared to lose me ... ...
899,118183810.6,Edgwired,i don't think he should be ... "if you're scared of losing someone, you obviously aren't secure in the relatlonship"
899,118183875.7,Other,i dunno ... i think if you aren't afraid ... then you aren't into it
899,118183898.6,Edgwired,also a possibility
899,118183898.9,Other,I mean I agree with you ... but I think your assumption is too idealisitc
899,118183938.4,Edgwired,it's the best possible understanding ... but it's like how i feel about my grandparents ... i mean to say ... it's possible ... "fear is going to be part of any normal relationship, but if you ever found someone where the fear went away, that's the person you should marry"
899,118184059.7,Other,it is ... hmmm ... I trust wes a lot ... i do love wes ... I just need him to get a job ... and get the fuck out of my hair ... and not just come here when he needs something
899,118184104.6,Edgwired,i'm sure you love wes
899,118184141.5,Other,and I think the attraction with Joey is because shit is hard with wes right now ... may mostly be it ... not that joey is really better ... besides ... I had someone who was JUST like me ... and we fought the same fight ... all the time ... wes has taught me not to be so afraid ... when we fight and wes walks away ... i used to bugg out ... but now I trust that if he loves me ... he'll come back ... or if he doesn't ... I'm better off ... I was always holding tedi in a fight ... just to keep him around ... i don't need that with wes ... he helps me maintain my independence ... i've never wanted to be alone more ... since i met wes ... besides ... I don't find joey sexy ... i just like that he is slightly obsessed with me
899,118184295.8,Edgwired,ha ... i think some of that is rationalization ... "in that absence of wes, you would still enjoy joey"
899,118184318.4,Other,yes
899,118184318.7,Edgwired,you didn't think wes was attractive either
899,118184323.2,Other,hmmm ... right ... well ... I see what you mean ... sigh ... i dunno
899,118184347.7,Edgwired,you came to a great conclusion
899,118184365.3,Other,whassat
899,118184366.9,Edgwired,i think you're learning from the experience and i think you learned quickly ... i think you're not done learning
899,118184378,Other,from wes ... or from joey ... or from both
899,118184387.7,Edgwired,same issue
899,118184391,Other,hmm ... k
899,118184396.7,Edgwired,eh ... strike that
899,118184400.3,Other,we'll see where it goes
899,118184401.7,Edgwired,new issue ... what you said just now was an old issue
899,118184423.2,Other,huh? ... :-/ ... whachumean?
899,118184447.7,Edgwired,"the tedi/wes comparison, as opposed to the wes/joey comparison" ... "one is recently gained knowledge, the other is a new question"
899,118184473.3,Other,right
899,118184475.4,Edgwired,not the only comparisons to be made ... but logically seperate
899,118184521.4,Other,ahh ... I see ... I think joey is like tedi ... he makes me miss tedi a lot ... A LOT ... he is a more mature tedi
899,118184552.2,Edgwired,maybe so ... although ... "you've just concluded that you are not the same person that you were with tedi, nor is joey like the tedi that you were with"
899,118184578.9,Other,right ... and joey does certain things that I always said I wanted in a man ... he came after me ... he waits for me ... and he had the balls to say the other night ... I understand why you're doing this ... but ... I just think I'm better for you
899,118184645.1,Edgwired,you defintely deserve that kind of attention
899,118184650.8,Other,spanks ... he's also a Libra ... my astrological match ... but that's corny
899,118184673.9,Edgwired,ga ... ja ... "i'm not saying it's ""better"" attention than wes can give you" ... but it's good attention
899,118184727.3,Other,right ... but you give me that ... and you are my friend ... maybe ... joey's just meant to be my friend
899,118184756,Edgwired,that's false hope
899,118184762.5,Other,oh?
899,118184767.6,Edgwired,yeah

974,103937004.7,Edgwired,how could you POSSIBLY turn down Elizabeth Taylor and Katherine Hepburn in the SAME MOVIE ... ?

974,103937096.8,Edgwired,LOL ... you were close to getting your gay card revoked ... although ... there IS something i have to ask you about
974,103937135.7,Other,ok whats that
974,103937145.2,Edgwired,did i happen to see a George Bush Icon by your name the other day?
974,103937157.6,Other,yeah
974,103937167.5,Edgwired,was it a joke?
974,103937177.2,Other,no
974,103937191.5,Edgwired,that's grounds for divorce
974,103937201.6,Other,we are not married yet
974,103937216.3,Edgwired,i'm saying ... in general ... for anyone ... you know
974,103937223.2,Other,lol
974,103937225.8,Edgwired,a reasonable person
974,103937234.8,Other,let me guess u dont like bush
974,103937293.7,Edgwired,I respect that George Bush believes what he says. ... However. ... fill in the argument ... ...
974,103937343,Other,i dont know what ur thinkin
974,103937363.2,Edgwired,you could pretty much pick an issue ... "he's like, the anti-me" ... better yet ... Dick Cheney is the anti-me
974,103937390.9,Other,i wouldnt say anti u - or me - ... why anti u
974,103937412.4,Edgwired,i don't lie to people on a regular basis
974,103937436,Other,i dont think the pres does either ... as a matter of a fact - as he stated in his press conf - the one thing u can count on - is when he says something he will do it
974,103937490,Edgwired,"he doesn't have the ability to consider alternate points of view, and that makes him a bad manageer"
974,103937514.1,Other,no i would say he is a very good manager - ... because he enables his ppl around him - and trust what they say
974,103937573,Edgwired,the people around him advise him with biased information
974,103937591.2,Other,TRUE ... because it is impossible not to be bias ... on any issue ... the ppl around him - have a like minded agenda - its the agenda of the ppl who put him office
974,103937672,Edgwired,i disagree. presenting something subjectively doesn't go as far as omitting critical information in order to sell a point ... that's bad business
974,103937693.5,Other,and r u refering to iraq
974,103937696.5,Edgwired,no ... not just
974,103937699.3,Other,then what
974,103937707.4,Edgwired,the perscription drug benefit ... the epa ... and on ... and on
974,103937737.2,Other,what about the benifis
974,103937777.3,Edgwired,a week after it was passed we found out the administration supressed the true cost from the congress
974,103937794.5,Other,see my issue is this - they say he didnt do a good job with the econ - now they are seeing that the bush tax cuts worked ... they say he did nothing with persecipt drugs for elders - no its not the best -but its a start and better then what they had
974,103937847.1,Edgwired,it's also going to cost one hundred fifty Billion more than they were willing to admit to ... No Child Left Behind is a regular disaster ... and ... the piece de resistence ... an Amendment ... against ... people like me
974,103937910.2,Other,now this is where u will not like me
974,103937912.4,Edgwired,building discrimination back into our constitution
974,103937930.9,Other,because - i think the pres is right on that issue ... he had no other choice ... when liberal courts decide to make laws - then elected officials - have no other recourse ... i thnk that marriage is defined as that of a man and woman - i do support civil unions - but when u go and redefine marriage thats an issue
974,103938016.4,Edgwired,marriage is a legal contract that falls under the rights of equal protection ... no judge made any law
974,103938040.2,Other,marriage lic is a legal act ... but marriage as it is defined - is that of a man and woman
974,103938069.5,Edgwired,the legal definition is the only one the counts ... moral definitions are contrary to founding principles
974,103938104.6,Other,but they are what the ppl know ... and they are what the ppl want
974,103938115.1,Edgwired,not what i want
974,103938143.1,Other,tell me why a civil union will not work for u
974,103938144.9,Edgwired,legislating morality is tyrrany
974,103938174.3,Other,ignoring it is detrimental to society
974,103938187.7,Edgwired,the romans did quite well for themselves
974,103938205.7,Other,so what made rome fall
974,103938238.8,Edgwired,"given enough time, everything changes"
974,103938252,Other,lets hope not
974,103938274.6,Edgwired,change is the only constant ... that's physics
974,103938308.7,Other,true - but maybe we need to change back some things
974,103938343,Edgwired,"well as long as we're revoking civil rights, there are a few i think you might want reconsider"
974,103938356.9,Other,what civil rights are we revoking ... "the stuggle i have is - how do u compare ones sexuality which is a personal and private issue with that of blacks, woman and other minorities - its not the same"
974,103938400.9,Edgwired,it most certainly is
974,103938410.6,Other,no it is not ... explain how
974,103938416.9,Edgwired,homosexuality isn't a choice ... or at least
974,103938428.5,Other,see and that is where we differ ... i think it is
974,103938456.2,Edgwired,made before we can be held responsible for it
974,103938467.9,Other,explain
974,103938487.9,Edgwired,most people know they're gay before they hit puberty
974,103938511.8,Other,but what about those who dont? ... do they make a choice
974,103938538,Edgwired,i don't think you can call instinct a choice ... and i dont think you can outlaw instinct ... and i think instinct is just as basic as sex ... or race
974,103938573.9,Other,i would disagree ... and see thats the difference - ur taking something that is not tangable and using it against a tanagble item and trying to make an argument with it ... now - so that u understand ... I am fine with my sexuality - ... its not something that i hide - but at the same time - it is not something i flaunt either ... the greatest form of acceptance for me - is when someone tells me they dont care ... because - the same way i dont want to know what my girlfriend and her bf are are doing in bed - is the same way i dont want to know who my gay friends are sleeping with
974,103938738,Edgwired,how can you translate the choice of ignorance into a constitutional amendment?
974,103938771.3,Other,it is not a choice of ignorance
974,103938784.1,Edgwired,"i don't want to know"
974,103938811.5,Other,i understand there are legal reason why a gay couple would want the legal benifits of a married couple ... "insurance, etc" ... i support that
974,103938832.6,Edgwired,and you can't accept that they want to make the same level of commitment>? ... under their own beliefs ... ? ... under a perfectly acceptable belief system?
974,103938855.1,Other,but isnt that pushing their believe system on everyone else
974,103938858.7,Edgwired,no ... because their marriage doesn't affect your beliefs
974,103938873.6,Other,but its not an acceptable belief system to everyone
974,103938876.1,Edgwired,how are you harmed by gay marriage?
974,103938891.7,Other,it does when it opens the door for any other type of act
974,103938902.1,Edgwired,because of course ... all homosexuals are pedophiles
974,103938916.3,Other,no not at all
974,103938921.2,Edgwired,that's the implication
974,103938923,Other,remember u r talkin to one
974,103938958.6,Edgwired,my lifestyle doesnt' open the door to bad things ... for other people
974,103938971.6,Other,ur lifestyle no ... but this act of gay marriage does ... what to say that a person says hey - if 2 guys can get married - then i want a 2nd wife - or even stranger i want to marry my goat - as crazy as it sounds - thats what can happen - and thats what ppl are afraid of
974,103939053.6,Edgwired,why do you care ... what other people choose to do with their lives ... you just said you don't want to know about it ... how would you feel
974,103939085.5,Other,its a morality issue
974,103939088,Edgwired,if someone started caring about things you do ... and prevented you from doing them
974,103939108.1,Other,and morality affects society lol
974,103939113.2,Edgwired,what's the difference between you and the worse redneck?
974,103939132.5,Other,i am blk
974,103939143.4,Edgwired,that's a coincidence
974,103939151,Other,but prob not much more then that - in ur thinkin
974,103939151.7,Edgwired,and a convenience
974,103939174.3,Other,how so
974,103939188.1,Edgwired,your argument is no different than Jerry Falwell's. it's just blunted.
974,103939206,Other,i have issues with Jerry ... but my issues with Jerry are a lil different
974,103939220.6,Edgwired,then i'm surprised you forward his ideals
974,103939230.2,Other,its not his ideals ... now grant u - i am prob the biggest oxymoron in the world
974,103939269.6,Edgwired,that's not a justification
974,103939282.2,Other,no but it does affect my thinkin and choices ... "see i am was raised one of those conservative right wing christians, went to Christian school - college - hell i even had a full ride to Jerry's school -" ... I understand the thought pattern of them ... for the most part - outside of me being gay - i am one ... and i struggled
974,103939400.9,Edgwired,and you were able to reconcile your sexuality with that moral code? ... because the only way to do that is develop your own belief system
974,103939416.1,Other,its hard - trust me it is truly difficult
974,103939424.5,Edgwired,which every individual ... at least in this society ... has a right to do ... that supercedes every other right
974,103939438.9,Other,nah - my believe system is still intact i would say
974,103939446.7,Edgwired,but it's your own ... it isn't the party line
974,103939455.3,Other,no not at all
974,103939458,Edgwired,it isn't what's in the book ... you've made up your own exceptions to the rule
974,103939474.4,Other,see - my issue with Christians today in regards to homosexual is simple ... no i made no exception to the rule ... if asked - i tell my christian friends and anyone
974,103939495.8,Edgwired,then you must hate yourself
974,103939520.7,Other,i make a conscience decision to do something that i know is wrong - and i dont have myself for it
974,103939539.4,Edgwired,you would be willing to be thrown in jail if you were caught?
974,103939613.8,Other,"but see Christians - they can forgive ever other type of sinner, from a murder, to a child molester, a thief - but we alienate the homosexual and wonder why they dont want to have anything to do with us - and its a fear issue - caus the reality of it is in the Chruch in great numbers" ... and for my believes - i think i can say i would be willing to be thrown in jail yes ... see its a lot easier to say something - and more difficult to act on it
974,103939715.7,Edgwired,and you've accepted the dictate that according to your own beliefs you're going to burn in a Christian hell?
974,103939771.1,Other,well according to my Christian believe system I dont burn in hell for my sins - i burn in hell for rejecting Christ
974,103939799.7,Edgwired,according to Paul you reject Christ with your sins
974,103939863.8,Other,see the great think about Christ and Christianity is - every other religion is based on what u do - but Christianity is based on what Christ did - and once u accept Christ - there is nothing u can do to lose it - its there for good
974,103939883.7,Edgwired,i hope that works out for you
974,103939914.6,Other,"it does - and see the good thing is - i knew that before i started acting on my homosexual ""instint"
974,103939942.8,Edgwired,yours is only one interpretation of Christianity among Christians ... many of them don't agree with you
974,103939966.6,Other,and i would argue to them ... prove it in the bible
974,103939984.9,Edgwired,the bible is full of contradictions
974,103939989.5,Other,lol
974,103939991.4,Edgwired,and things we find morally reprehensible
974,103940014.9,Other,u may think - but to a christian - it is the basic of life - and everything one needs for life is in it ... so if they argue Christianity any other way then mine - they better be able to back it up - thats all i am saying
974,103940107.3,Edgwired,what if a Christian put to you the Bible's interpretation of a womans place?
974,103940139,Other,explain ... u mean to be submissive
974,103940159.7,Edgwired,not just ... women deserved to be stoned when they disobey?
974,103940229.5,Other,under the law ... "old testament - under law new testament - under grace" ... wow - i didnt think i would end up on this conversation
974,103940405.7,Edgwired,these are the only ones that matter to me
974,103940452.4,Other,good to know ... i prob didnt score many points with u then :-)
974,103940485.8,Edgwired,"eh, you have the strength of conviction" ... which is respectable ... but the logical ends of your arguments are places i don't go
974,103940507.3,Other,thank u ... u know i tend not to bring up my religious opinion esp when i am talkin to gays - i try to keep it to myself for that very reason - and others
974,103940659.3,Edgwired,i don't talk about religion or politics ... as anything but intellectual exercises
974,103940697.8,Other,well i think politics esp this election will be a major decididng factor in our nation
974,103940819.7,Edgwired,i would consider leaving if we continue with the current policy
974,103940832.4,Other,really
974,103940837.2,Edgwired,yes
974,103940839.4,Other,why is that
974,103940976.7,Edgwired,it's depressing to watch malice spread
974,103940999.6,Other,explain
974,103941113.4,Edgwired,i don't enjoy judgemental people or policies made at the expense of of others
974,103941144.6,Other,every policy is made at the expense of others
974,103941186.7,Edgwired,"if you believe that, then you have less understanding of creativity than i expected"
974,103941215.4,Other,no no ... i am very creative and understanding - but the bottom line is that is true ... name any policy - and someone is not happy with it
974,103941316.8,Edgwired,"not everyone has to be happy, they just deserve to be considered."
974,103941328.5,Other,agreed ... i couldnt agree with u more
974,103941470.6,Edgwired,"not prejudicially considered, but actually listened to"
974,103941509.2,Other,i agree ... but that means all side ... I dont mind those who disagree with me - i think thats a good thing - and provide balance - and I dont always have to win - as long as the decisions that is reached is the best one for everyone - its all about balance -
974,103941639.1,Edgwired,i think it's pretty fair to say that the past four years have given us legislation that isn't in the best interests of everyone ... haven't
974,103941667.2,Other,i wouldnt say that at all
974,103941709.8,Edgwired,ok ... enough
974,103941716.6,Other,ok how bout this ... i have to run - ... but next time we chat - lets just talk about ur excellent movie selection
974,103941749.3,Edgwired,ok ... enjoy your night
974,103941754.6,Other,cya cutie ... yeah i have to lay carpet - its going to be a blast ... enjoy urs - ... and hopefully we can see past our differnces - and maybe chill one day ... but i get to pick the movie :-P
974,103941839.5,Edgwired,k
975,104156290.1,Other,hey whats up hottie

976,100470600.3,Other,I hate to be stuck in kville during spring break ... everyone else is off having orgiastic sex but me :-\
976,100470638.4,Edgwired,you need a hooker
976,100470643.1,Other,i need to get laid ... quite honestly
977,100474284.1,Other,the gayest boy in the world just came up to the desk
977,100474295.9,Edgwired,did you ask him how much?
977,100474305.8,Other,he got an attitude with me ... which I did not appreciate
977,100474334.3,Edgwired,over?
977,100474345,Other,the location of the copy machines
977,100474349.8,Edgwired,figures

977,100474375.2,Edgwired,ask him how much?
977,100474379.5,Other,hahah ... he's pretty cute
977,100474409.4,Edgwired,he's not cute enough to get a free bitching pass
977,100474421.4,Other,that's true ... he had the nasty attitude...not the fun gay bitchy attitude
977,100474466.6,Edgwired,maybe he isn't getting laid either
977,100474496.1,Other,could be...I know my attitude has deteriorated since my last flogging
977,100474510.7,Edgwired,ew ... flogging?
977,100474524.5,Other,sorry...bad joke ... fine..since my last fucking
978,100474651.5,Other,"I may go home, get naked, and go to bed"
978,100474668.9,Edgwired,that's usually what i do
979,100474878,Other,I don't like to lay naked though
979,100474890.2,Edgwired,then don't ... ?
979,100474916,Other,well ... i guess that makes sense
979,100474938.8,Edgwired,that's what i'm here for
979,100474963.3,Other,so I'm staying with some fag at penn when I come ... did I tell you?
979,100474980.8,Edgwired,no
979,100474988.4,Other,well i am
979,100475003.4,Edgwired,on purpose?
979,100475017.4,Other,that's who I was put with
979,100475043.6,Edgwired,i don't quite understand how this information gets circulated
979,100475059.7,Other,the fact the some people suck dick?
979,100475068.2,Edgwired,yes
979,100475080.4,Other,well...it does ... you have experience with Penn...you should be the one tellingme
979,100475110,Edgwired,i would be kind of shocked if the university used that as a way to assign something ... at least in my case
979,100475145.8,Other,well...I guess the dude thinks the queers will feel more comfortable staying with other queers
979,100475222.1,Edgwired,it sounds like they're going out of their way to get you to come
979,100475239,Other,well...i think it's just part of their whole plan ... but it does make sense ... I kept me from having to get a hotel for 3 nights ... I only had to get it for one night
979,100475340,Edgwired,make him take you out
979,100475365.9,Other,he is...the lambda law people are taking all the q's out ... ok...my shift is over thank god ... I am going to the house ... I will talk to you later
979,100475519.1,Edgwired,k

980,100488604.6,Edgwired,send her a cake ... witha file in it
980,100488622,Other,haha...such a tragedy ... some big bulldyke is gonna make her a bitch

1013,116208878.5,Edgwired,my best friend maria i guess you could call bisexual ... but ... she's dates boys mostly ... i'd like more gay friends ... it would make it easier to hunt
1013,116208944.9,Other,yeah
1013,116208962.6,Edgwired,although ... most gay dudes i don't like ... so go figure
1013,116209041,Other,I agree totaly ... I dont click with many of them ... and most of gay guys are VERY superficial and vain ... and thats just to sad
1013,116209092.9,Edgwired,"i'm pretty vain, but i'm not superficial" ... sometimes to my own detriment ... it's easy to be shallow
1013,116209222.9,Other,lol ... I think its a turn off
1013,116209233.1,Edgwired,sure ... i'm not nearly as vain as i used to be... so that's an improvement ... "i guess by the time i'm 40 i should be normal, yet ugly" ... ha ... joke
1013,116209325.2,Other,lol
1013,116209349.4,Edgwired,actually ... i wonder if it's vanity if you only care about your own opinion and no one elses ... probably ... even more so
1013,116209377,Other,all I can say is whatever makes you happy for for it
1013,116209385.5,Edgwired,looking good makes me happy

1013,116209456.2,Edgwired,from other's i'm just me
1013,116209465,Other,and thats the best
1013,116209475.2,Edgwired,i'm satisfied with it ... i think that may be my out on relationships though ... i haven't run across a gay boy who agrees
1013,116209572.5,Other,maybe they find you intimidating?
1013,116209584.6,Edgwired,that's pretty par for the course
1013,116209589.6,Other,or maybe you just have a look that you dont want anything serious?
1013,116209591.3,Edgwired,but frustrating and stupid ... nah ... i actually fall into relationships really easily ... under the right circumstance ... s ... really ... it's anyone who says yes ... eh ... that's an odd way of putting it
1013,116209671.3,Other,oh I c
1013,116209684.8,Edgwired,put it this way ... i've had 3 boyfriends in my life ... each of which just happened ... all of a sudden ... none of which ... lasted very long
1013,116209750.5,Other,aww ... sorry
1013,116209752.8,Edgwired,all of which i learned from ... don't be ... i value the experience ... but thank you ... anyway

1013,116209878.3,Other,yeah it was awesome ... I miss them all a lot ... or maybe just the sex? I dont know LOL
1013,116209906.2,Edgwired,nah ... them probably ... i find it difficult to keep sex interesting after a while ... unless you're willing to really play like kids
1013,116209940,Other,actually ... the 4 year one ... was never boring ... we liked to spice it up ... in the bedroom ... so always hot times
1013,116209970.9,Edgwired,in what ways?
1013,116209993.3,Other,oh you name it ... he was kinda on the dominant side ... so it would get wild
1013,116210027.2,Edgwired,good for you ... i like to switch it up a lot
1013,116210053.4,Other,in what way?
1013,116210075.2,Edgwired,"toys, slings, props, you name it" ... the only thing i think i'm over ... as far as relationships are concerned ... are groups ... i'm too much of a jealous bastard ... i guess
1013,116210097.5,Other,lol ... I never did groups ... I am very jelous type
1013,116210115.2,Edgwired,much better when you're single IMO
1013,116210117.5,Other,I would kick their ass if they touch my man
1013,116210160.3,Edgwired,yeah ... my last bf insisted on threesomes ... because that was how he like to keep sex interesting ... but ... waking up to him with someone else ... was too much ... i went postal
1013,116210216.4,Other,sorry man ... I could NEVER do that ... to me if a guy asks for a 3some it only shows that he is no longer interested in me ... that I dont do anything for him anymore
1013,116210285,Edgwired,"yeah, it was a pretty loose thing anyway i guess, in retrospect" ... i got kicked out of my house with him
1013,116210300.9,Other,I dated this one guy for like 3 weeks
1013,116210301.1,Edgwired,so we were sticking together for a while
1013,116210311.7,Other,on a 3rd week ... he asked if we could have a 3some ... I was like bye bye
1013,116210392.4,Edgwired,yeah ... i think i'd really love it if someone were that protective over me ... but it hasn't happened yet
1013,116210425,Other,well I dont know ... my X didnt like that ... "he thought I didnt ""trust him" ... cause I am very very protective of my man
1013,116210517.5,Edgwired,hmmm ... to what extent?
1013,116210608.2,Other,but he loved the fact I would get jelous if someone tried to hit on him ... he actually did it on porpuse ... to see me get all edgy ... that bitch ... lol
1013,116210628.4,Edgwired,heh ... i'd have to say ... it would be sexy in a way ... i think it would turn me on ... but then again
1013,116210647.1,Other,then he would come to me and kiss me infront of everyone and call me silly
1013,116210649.4,Edgwired,i'd hate to be accused of something i didn't do
1013,116210682.5,Other,nah he was cool ... he would tell whoever came up to him straight up that he is with me ... but of course some fags cant take no for an answer
1013,116210737.7,Edgwired,heh ... so do you go out in Philly?
1013,116210749.9,Other,so thats when I step it and kick their ass ... I dont know anyone in Philly ... so dont go out much

1013,116211301.4,Other,oh I'd like that alot

1013,116211339.8,Edgwired,everybody can dance
1013,116211350.8,Other,I guess because in the Military we just learn to observe and protec ... so I am on the look out all the time LOL

1091,118558341.2,Edgwired,interesting ... i never have that problem on my mac ... but i've heard that from some ppl with pcs ... it's just flash
1091,118558415.1,Other,"i know...i've worked with flash. in 7th grade, i was a computer loser who knew html and worked with java...when it took forever to load" ... so tell me about your rub down last night

1091,118558489.6,Other,oh ok ... not the type of guy i would see you with ... interesting
1091,118558524.5,Edgwired,we had martinis ... talked local politics ... went upstairs ... ... ... at one point ... i was on the corner of the waterbed ... bent over backwards and gripping the wall for all it was worth ... i have a nice mark on my back for my trouble ... very hot indeed ... then i put him to sleep with some energy work
1091,118558639.2,Other,fun ... no sex?
1091,118558648.5,Edgwired,ha ... "bent over backwards gripping the wall for all it was worth""?" ... what do you think could put me into that position?
1091,118558702.8,Other,i thought u were getting a massage
1091,118558708.5,Edgwired,post massage ... i skipped over that part
1091,118558716,Other,oh ... u bttmed?
1091,118558723.9,Edgwired,both ... vers ... i started on top ... "incidentally, what type of guy do you think i would be seen with?"
1091,118558792,Other,"well, granted you don't have a great body. you're skinny...at least that what it appears in your pics. so that lowers your standards"
1091,118558807.4,Edgwired,ha
1091,118558829.9,Other,just not a gay bar bartender
1091,118558853.5,Edgwired,that's pretty funny ... the boys i'm with are very well put together ... http://neocyde.net/art/smallwonder.html ... first boyfriend ... http://neocyde.net/art/figment.html ... second bf
1091,118558968.6,Other,omg...gross ... way not what i expected ... i think it has to do with the colors ... "but still, not what i expected" ... i thought more along preppy lines
1091,118559016.7,Edgwired,i was a party kid ... when i dated them
1091,118559031.5,Other,then you're contridicting yourself
1091,118559036.7,Edgwired,how is that?
1091,118559045.4,Other,well put together VS party kids ... not establishing a clear case with me ;) ... but i just enjoy giving you a HARD time
1091,118559078.6,Edgwired,i don't see why those things are mutually exclusive ... however ... i see the point you're making ... and ... i can only say that we're talking about a span of about five years
1091,118559134.2,Other,it's ok...not everyone is as perfect as i am ... nor do i expect them to live up to my standards ... O:-) ... <--- ugly on the inside and out
1091,118559202,Edgwired,"when i was your age, i looked like this: http://neocyde.net/built.jpg" ... now i look like this: http://neocyde.net/bathtime2.jpg
1091,118559218.6,Other,good to make improvements ... i know...i have the 2nd one saved
1091,118559228.3,Edgwired,that pretty much sums it up
1091,118559243.6,Other,i'm curious and doubtful you look as hot as your 2nd pic in real life ... i think u lucked up and took an amazing pic
1091,118559272.5,Edgwired,it's possible ... most people don't think so ... i get an excellent response when i'm out
1091,118559296.1,Other,as do i ... but i'm really not that attractive ... ;)
1091,118559357.6,Edgwired,"after a certain point, hot boys are just hot boys. i've been with enough to know they're interchangable"
1091,118559412.6,Other,the thing is that i'm not just hot...i have the entire package...and most people throw themselves at me for one reason or another ... which i'm sure you'll do
1091,118559456.4,Edgwired,"actually, i think you'll be more attractive in about 5 years, when you're secure enough in it to not need to acknowledge it"
1091,118559500.7,Other,hahaha...i'm really not as cocky about it as i appear on here. you're just chatting with me after i've been ripping apart a whartonite tonight ... it's a game for me ... but that's another story ... "at last, i am sleepy!!!" ... lol ... please don't think i'm a cocky ass...i was just dick'n around ... "i'm a very sweet guy, nothing all that special"
1091,118559568.8,Edgwired,"dr jekyll, meet mr hyde"
1091,118559583.5,Other,haha...which ones the real me?
1091,118559589.9,Edgwired,i suspect you're probably what you say
1091,118559590.3,Other,or am i still playing with your head
1091,118559596.2,Edgwired,however ... you're also on the far side of a lot of things i learned a long time ago ... it's easy to be a big fish ... however the point is to conceal your power until you truly need to call on it ... "people like us recognize each other for what we are, without having to put it on display" ... i met someone today in fact ... "if you're self-aware, you convey it nonverbally"
1091,118559976.6,Other,"we're online, nothing is ever verbal. but one lesson i have learned is don't pass judgments and attempt to analyze something online...online is just a giant fake force. i believe if you encountered me in real life, things would be much different."
1091,118559996.1,Edgwired,clearly
1091,118560001.1,Other,indeed ... but i must sleep
1091,118560009.3,Edgwired,sleep well
1091,118560046.9,Other,"thank you for making me smile...i think under the horn dog that you appear to be online, you're more than a cute face...we'd probably get along quite well" ... we'll have to conduct that experiment eventually
1091,118560069.3,Edgwired,at a date to be determined in the future
1091,118560089.1,Other,yeap...the king has left the building...peace out

1092,119076368.6,Edgwired,"no idea, last year it was invite only and we ended up with over a hundred" ... the house was packed to the gills ... and it's a *house*
1092,119076390.4,Other,"and of course you should realize if i'm coming, i must bring a friend or 2...for comfort"

1092,119076606.1,Edgwired,i haven't thought about it yet. basically i think that wherever this party leads to is where i'll be ... it will most likely be a weekend long bender
1092,119076641.2,Other,yea
1092,119076647.3,Edgwired,if i had to take a guess i'd say Zete's at Penn

1092,119076807.9,Edgwired,"years ago it was the best party of the year. now, i only know alumni, so i'm taking a wait and see attitude"
1092,119076889.4,Other,Henri David Ball is the big thing now ... or it was last year ... the wildest party ... "and your ticket price goes towards AIDS research, i do believe"

1093,119319458.1,Other,doubtful...i saw 2 people i was attracted to...one being this asian kid dancing...and the other was the guy handing out beer with his shirt off
1093,119319474.5,Edgwired,you left right as i got there ... i passed right in front of you on my cellphone ... but i had my head down
1093,119319516.2,Other,how would u know i was leaving? the guy with the orange shirt wasn't with me right when we were leaving
1093,119319531.7,Edgwired,left the dj on 12th anyway ... i stayed there for about 20 minutes

1093,119319895.4,Edgwired,i think that's what you were doing when i saw you ... i thought in this particular case ... the lesbians were much better dressed than the fags ... "which is out of the ordinary, or so says maria" ... i saw a couple girls that were smokin ... i almost always dance when i hear a dj ... i was so fucking beat that day too ... but it's fun to get more people going

1194,106803354.5,Edgwired,these are very small things ... footnotes ... really
1194,106803388.7,Other,someone who recognizes these as footnotes is surely worthy of my attention
1194,106803428.6,Edgwired,worthy to be sure ... but ... oh no but ... forget it ... i'm being argumentative ... silly really ... point is ... there are many faces here
1194,106803453.5,Other,you are being adorably cute ... i like what i see

1194,106803665.2,Other,ok ... mikee
1194,106803671.1,Edgwired,Vic
1194,106803677.2,Other,i am growing quite fond of you :)

1194,106803697.3,Other,"i wasborn in india, raised there for a bit, and the rest in texas"
1194,106803705.4,Edgwired,quite the combo

1194,106803740.2,Edgwired,are you as passionate about Pakistan as my CEO?

1194,106803759.8,Edgwired,eh ... if you so please
1194,106803766,Other,no ... "actually, i think india is way beyond pakistan now" ... most indians are fixated on china now ... not pakistan ... pakistan is america's problem now ... what with all the nuclear leaks and the mullahs
1194,106803850.4,Edgwired,china is a problem? ... for india?
1194,106803857.9,Other,hell yeah ... huge ... they fought a brief but brutal war in 1962 ... china basiically raped india ... and still holds large swathes of territory
1194,106803911,Edgwired,how much fun would it be to have 2 billion people at war
1194,106803917.2,Other,hehe ... some quick population control ... both nuclear powers ... yeah it would be fun ... except for the fucking himalayas ... or else we could just have two billion folks running at each other ... now THAT would be fun to watch
1194,106804022.9,Edgwired,you'd have to have a wide angle lens
1194,106804034,Other,yeah.. very wide ... but doable
1194,106804096.2,Edgwired,i think we should model it first ... at a National lab
1194,106804106.7,Other,you think?
1194,106804118.9,Edgwired,so we can compare results
1194,106804133.1,Other,it'd just be a billion red dots and a billion green dots smashing into each other ... not too exciting
1194,106804205.7,Edgwired,green dots and blue dots turning into red dots then black dots ... piles of dots ... i wonder if they would procreate?
1194,106804249.8,Other,hmm.. yeah.. that would be an interesting twist to the program ... although i don't see people fucking on the frontlines
1194,106804280.4,Edgwired,i would ... hell yeah
1194,106804286.5,Other,haha ... are you a fucker or a fuckee?
1194,106804316.1,Edgwired,depends on the drugs at hand

1194,106804466.2,Other,haha ... how hung are you?

1194,106804756,Edgwired,"here i will insert the reminder that i'm not looking for a relationship, or sex for that matter"
1194,106804771.3,Other,i know ... you told me that already ... i am being persistent ... :)
1194,106804817.2,Edgwired,the line of questioning infers otherwise
1194,106804836.2,Other,lol ... "well, i do want to date someone" ... and you seem perfect
1194,106804877.9,Edgwired,that may be a tragedy
1194,106804887.2,Other,why?
1194,106804973.2,Edgwired,because i'm not prepared to participate
1194,106804998.2,Other,"haha, why not?"
1194,106805013,Edgwired,policy of truth
1194,106805043.6,Other,hmm?
1194,106805099.2,Edgwired,it's just the guidelines i live by ... my last bf was the last
1194,106805126.1,Other,was it a bad experience?
1194,106805144.9,Edgwired,each of them
1194,106805159,Other,care to talk about it?
1194,106805177.9,Edgwired,"not particularly, it's in the past"
1194,106805194.7,Other,but it clouds your future
1194,106805204,Edgwired,"actually, no"
1194,106805208.1,Other,and i am very keenly intersted in your future
1194,106805210.6,Edgwired,i'm much happier this way
1194,106805212.9,Other,so please? ... please? ... tell me what happened?
1194,106805269.7,Edgwired,that requires a very complex response ... for which i have no place to begin or the energy to complete
1194,106805292.5,Other,let us at least start ... was it due to infidelity?
1194,106805351.2,Edgwired,some
1194,106805357.4,Other,ah ... and the rest?
1194,106805392.7,Edgwired,miscommunication?
1194,106805397.7,Other,i see

1194,106805648.9,Edgwired,LOL ... no no ... you see ... were we to transfer the metaphor ... you would care for yourself ... and not about me
1194,106805671.8,Other,lol ... i am not transfering the metaphor ... i am adapting it to my taste
1194,106805828.5,Edgwired,your adaptation perverts the raw materials ... there a reasons ... quite good ones ... for remaining ... and ... i'm going to sleep ... very soon
1194,106805867.5,Other,waaaaaaaait ... talk to me mikey ... mikee ... you should give me a chance ... we should hang out ... get a cuppa coffeee ... who knows? we may be each other's perfect mates

1202,106102309.9,Other,nothing... ... misa makes my head hurt sometimes... now she's not coming until god only knows ... like she's sooo unsure of things and it sucks ... because on the other side of that sometimes she is sure ... *bangs head against desk* ... women... ... *shakes head*
1202,106102412.2,Edgwired,deep breath
1202,106102471,Other,like she wants to move here with me but she doesn't want to move here for me... and I'm cool with that... but she doesn't think I understand and she freaks when I tell her I do ... i know she's at a scary time but tht doesn't mean she has to do it alone... ... but I can't convince her of that ... it's kind of frustratiing.. ... i just want her here already...
1202,106102574.7,Edgwired,i'm thinking maybe it would be better if she did it on her own
1202,106102591.1,Other,me too... sort of.. now... ... im just worries that she'll never get here... ... and i'll be left... ... right where I was before... ... alone... and very confused. ... boohiss

1202,106102652.6,Other,i need a drink
1202,106102665.1,Edgwired,check it out ... the only way it's going to work is if you can be ok if it doesn't
1202,106102689.6,Other,i know
1202,106102692.2,Edgwired,otherwise you're co-dependent
1202,106102699.4,Other,but sometimes I think its going to work... ... then... it does' ... t ... like right now I could be hanging out with maria... but Im not because I might have this life coming up with misa ... so it's like im on hold for something that might not even happen ... for once in my life im getting attention... I don't know who's to accept ... being a monk fucking sucks!
1202,106102807,Edgwired,lol ... yup
1202,106102835.1,Other,maria's nice and being friends with her will be cool... ... but ... she reminds me of misa ... it sucks ... why can't i just be a bastard like every other guy on the planet... ... being wholesome sucks! ... i could just spit ... *kicks dirt*
1202,106102909.2,Edgwired,Weston ... it's a point of view ... you can be wholesome and enjoy it ... or you can be dirty and not care ... but doesn't have to use two good things to make bad
1202,106102982.1,Other,im confused
1202,106102994,Edgwired,just enjoy yourself right now ... and don't worry about what might be
1202,106103009.3,Other,but what if it bites me in the ass ... "im scared, mike.. scared of ruining something I don't even know I have..." ... but at the same time...
1202,106103056.9,Edgwired,much easier to say that you made the decisions knowing you were happy
1202,106103067.4,Other,i'm lonely..
1202,106103073,Edgwired,"and really, you can keep making decisions that way" ... they work themselves out ... at least in my experience ... so far
1202,106103111.5,Other,i guess I just don't want anyone to get hurt ... but I... maybe I can't prevnt that for the rest of my life...
1202,106103137.1,Edgwired,you absolutely should not fall before your fear ... if you're afraid of something ... you go out and do it ... BECAUSE you are afraid ... and by doing it ... you rid yourself of the fear
1202,106103166.9,Other,and see what happens?
1202,106103168.8,Edgwired,and the lesson

1202,106103250.5,Edgwired,don't be afraid of her
1202,106103252.7,Other,maybe it's better this way.. ... its not her ... it the situation ... "we are ""playful"" people..." ... things that could happen.. is what I've feared. ... that's why i've been a monk.. ... because of fear
1202,106103323.3,Edgwired,don't be afraid
1202,106103335.2,Other,go with it?

1204,108433203.8,Other,I love maria. Maria loves me. Misa knows. Everyone's still happy. And everything is going to be ok.

1204,108433250.6,Other,don't know ... that for her to decide... the pressure is off. Now she can be free to do what she wants for herself.

1204,108434215.8,Edgwired,that's nothing new
1204,108434218.6,Other,LOL ... im confused like that too.
1204,108434254.2,Edgwired,she wants a mint julip ... just so you know

1205,110933070.2,Other,i know that feeling well
1205,110933070.6,Edgwired,i'm glad i found out when i did
1205,110933076.2,Other,yeah... ... now you are free to move on to bigger and better things ... :)
1205,110933097,Edgwired,ha ... in the long run definitely ... i'm disappointed about not moving ... but it gives me the opportunity to take care of my Penn bill ... my dad wants me to start working with him in Jersey
1205,110933158.5,Other,how well would that work...?
1205,110933165.4,Edgwired,probably stressful
1205,110933166,Other,do you get along with him
1205,110933170.7,Edgwired,ha ... sometimes ... not going to be easy work ... but ... it's worthwhile
1205,110933190.8,Other,well that's something
1205,110933200.4,Edgwired,wouldn't have happened this way if it wasn't the right thing to do
1205,110933206.4,Other,yeah ... good outlook in the face of unfortunate events
1205,110933231.5,Edgwired,right ... just a change ... really
1205,110933240.7,Other,that's cool. ... :)
1205,110933253.8,Edgwired,how's the house hunt going for you?
1205,110933260.3,Other,horribly.
1205,110933264.3,Edgwired,oh man
1205,110933271.8,Other,i'm now getting worried. ... it's sooooo hard finding a half way decent place for cheap in this city... ... not impossible... but very hard
1205,110933308,Edgwired,very true ... are you just looking in CC?
1205,110933336.7,Other,yeah... and in the close surroundings ... i like being able to walk places without 30 minutes going by
1205,110933364.3,Edgwired,haa
1205,110933374.7,Other,it makes the search harder ... im going to look at a place on Friday at 22 & spruce.
1205,110933406,Edgwired,that's a great neighborhood
1205,110933419.7,Other,it's a basement apartment with a patio ... so I don't know ... but it's cheap and the area IS great
1205,110933449.8,Edgwired,definitely ... when i was looking for a single ... that's the area i thought would work out best
1205,110933510.4,Other,i hope it does ... i'm getting frustrated ... but I have karma on my side... at least I hope I do. ... i usually do
1205,110933565.6,Edgwired,i'm sure it will work out ... you have options at least
1205,110933582.1,Other,some but few ... it'll work out ... it has to ... I have to get out of here. ... before I knock Imri out
1205,110933609.8,Edgwired,ha ... i didn't get a response from him ... but
1205,110933646.7,Other,so he knows... I was going to ask... but I decided I didn't want to hear him bitch
1205,110933648.5,Edgwired,i'm not worried about it really ... oh yeah
1205,110933655.1,Other,don't be
1205,110933655.7,Edgwired,i called ... and left a message ... and also sent a message ... they have a month to find someone
1205,110933673.6,Other,he'll just have to deal
1205,110933674.6,Edgwired,which with what they have should be easy
1205,110933683.6,Other,it will be
1205,110933719.9,Edgwired,"i regret that it didn't work out way ahead of time for them, but i'm also not sure i was set up with the best situation if i did more in" ... move in
1205,110933726.1,Other,he didn't believe I was moving for the first 6 times I told him was
1205,110933735.8,Edgwired,ha ... well ... i'm only telling him once
1205,110933744.1,Other,good ... Maria's going to kill him... ... or whip him to shape...
1205,110933766.9,Edgwired,"yeah, and that's before she's even moved in"
1205,110933772.8,Other,whatever happens first ... that's what he needs. ... but if he hits on her again... I'm going to hit him... hard.
1205,110933816,Edgwired,ha ... i wonder if he's ever been socked ... probably
1205,110933828.2,Other,probably. ... he & I barely speak these days... when we do it's civil... but that's all me... i'm holding back until I move. ... i wanna slip out quietly.
1205,110933914.7,Edgwired,i can dig that ... myself ... has been piped up pretty often lately ... probably to my own detriment ... but ... for some reason ... i don't feel like putting up with bullshit
1205,110933955.5,Other,yeah ... i know the feeling ... im sure you had things youi wanted to say to me.
1205,110934003.3,Edgwired,ha ... not really ... not nearly as many as maria wanted me to say ... but i've removed myself from the issue entirely
1205,110934035.4,Other,really? ... it's probably safer that way
1205,110934050.5,Edgwired,LOL ... truer words have never been spoken
1205,110934136,Other,trying to explain or question my mental issues is hard. Maria handles it well... but it's best to leave it up to her. She's keeping my interest just fine.
1205,110934152.4,Edgwired,um ... Wes
1205,110934155.9,Other,And she controls my issues like no other
1205,110934157,Edgwired,my advice to you ... is to control your own issues
1205,110934171.2,Other,oh I do. ... but she is the motivation... ... the looking glass. ... I see who I could be in her eyes... ... who I am ... :) ... who I forgot I was
1205,110934259.2,Edgwired,"yeah, she has a skill for elevation" ... but she's also human
1205,110934300.4,Other,i know... that's why it's the buddy system... I try to give back what she gives to me. ... it good policy
1205,110934320,Edgwired,just as long as you give it back on both ends ... don't be her bitch ... it's unbecoming
1205,110934344.9,Other,:p ... she's a tough cookie... you know... ... but oh so sweet. ... and tasty.
1205,110934377,Edgwired,ha ... "she's acts tough, that's for sure"
1205,110934387.8,Other,HA ... i'm seeing that now... she's a soft cookie... like myself. ... ;)
1205,110934436.5,Edgwired,in some ways she is very vulnerable ... like everyone else i know
1205,110934445.1,Other,as am I
1205,110934453.5,Edgwired,she fights back though
1205,110934457.2,Other,we should start a club
1205,110934458,Edgwired,if you press her buttons ... it's borderline irrational
1205,110934465.2,Other,boy do I knoww that
1205,110934473.7,Edgwired,but i totally understand how that happens
1205,110934483.7,Other,we take turns being irrational ... and I also know when to step back and let her get it all out before I speak ... it's about... patience. ... im learning that again
1205,110934624.8,Edgwired,"yeah, i'm glad you two worked out your differences" ... i'm probably going to bow out of the scene for a while ... she'll need someone
1205,110934702.5,Other,you can bow out of the scene (god knows I have) but don't you dare bow out from us. ... i'm just getting to know you...with her.
1205,110934770.5,Edgwired,"nah, i think it's going to be all inclusive. you and she will have your space, i'll be around but it's time to let that rest for a while"
1205,110934818.5,Other,boohiss ... :(
1205,110934822.1,Edgwired,ha ... it's an unavoidable cycle ... that i go through ... ok ... i'm going for food ... i'll catch up with you later ... enjoy your night
1206,121127377.1,Other,I can only say this one thing before I leave from work... ... thank you for bringing Kim to your party. ... :)

1208,116019503.2,Edgwired,good choice ... "i just started a new job that keeps me wound up, so i think i'm getting into the weekend warrior thing" ... only this little injun is pretty wounded
1208,116019551.1,Other,haha ... fashion design?
