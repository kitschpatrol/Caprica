"yeah perhaps wes should talk with us about it, but he's been moody" well he has till the 31st of july to move i've been letting maria take the lead because she's better at discussing than I unless he decides he's staying yeah maria and i were looking for a place together "wich if he does stay, i think it would be odd with maria there..." not that i know anything but i know things LOL no shit well i can pretty much tell you that she would NOT live with Wes not because they have problems but just because too early maybe hehe no need to explain that "if wes will even talk to me, ill have a chat with him and imri tonight..." "thing is, if juan is the only one moving, i dont think we will take on another roomate" right that's good chief "but ill let imri know u were interested, and once we discuss things with wes, we'll have a better idea" k thanks for letting me know i'm good with it being up in the air for a while but it will be nice to know i hear ya "ok, back to work for me" k laters enjoy hey mike u there? yup what's up chief i got ur PM oh good i was wondering why imri didnt tell u how much rent would be no idea it's always been 400ish ok well here is the exact breakdown the room i currently reside in will be vacant k it is the cheapest room the room wes resides in is more expensive the rent will be $385 and $455 respectively for each room ok "u need 1st, last, and security to move in" "so depending on which room u take, that decides the price" ok thanks for the info i guess maria would have first dibbs because she asked first she does we talked about it which room are you going to take? Juans ok she was just concerned about music late at night OMG well Imri has no respect for anyone as far as that goes so good luck! haha right i told her she needs to take the opposite room of wherever he is "honestly, i would have moved out if i had the money" i am stuck man i've been there many times so are you still considering those other people?? ha one question mark there are no other people heheh OH my mistake "about two months ago, i entertained my brother as a possibility" "and before we even agreed i was staying, i ruled that out" "then, a girl named kristin wanted to move in" "imri did not want her to, because she is young" ok i had wanted my girlfriend to live there but imri doesnt want that either ok so maria is coming over to swim in a minute can i just tell her that we should get this arranged? we talked to Imri about it last week and he was cool with it as long as we talked to you what i'm really trying to decide is how much money i can put on this party this weekend and still come out well enough to buy furniture "haha, my friend Dan says that he's listened to Breakdown 3 well over a hundred times and he wants a new one." haha hey sorry someone came in im at work sooo anyways yeah np yeah so i guess it comes out to either 1155 for my old room or 1375 for wes's ok i have to double check on the rent for wes's room tho but i believe he's been paying 445 a month but rent goes up this year so it will be 455 a month ok i've got that down that's definitely good to know going to take the month to put it together im assuming maria would take wes's old room? most likely u know anyone else looking for a place besides you two? i am just curious "um, i've had a few people express interest" but nothing firm werd Happy Easter happy easter...whats happening? "not much chief, just landed back at home from dinner with my father's inlaws" what' s up with you? not much....just checkin up on the emory baseball team.....they are having a really good season. hows life? pretty good i turned down those jobs in Japan pat was telling me about those....whats the story? bad timing for grad school among other things are you applying to grad schools? this year i hope i have to get a portfolio together portfolio? what are you going to school for? Art awesome......what a re you thinking about probably coding graphics but i'm not tied to it yet tough to say which school i could get in so sort of like what your doing now? "yup, except doing it for real instead of bullshitting" or are you thinking video game type stuff? more tool based like creating ways to visualize sound thats cool.....hows the job now going? very well we have money and i decided after the interviews that i'm pretty happy with it thats always a plus.....hows the selling coming? the japan interviews? they're good on the investment side and horrible with the marketing yup yeah that can be tough.....but its all just selling themselves right? that's what they're pretty good at.. i think the retail strategy is dumb though... my opinion is that we should start with big institutional licenses and then sell to individuals yeah thats probably true. just as long as they keep paying YOU thats all that matters........at this point HA right they said they would break their lease at the office before they stopped paying me and Gonzo so even if we do run out of money i'll have a little bit of a heads up nice....whos gonzo? the network admin how's it going with school for you? you're almost done right? its going alright....yup almost done....thank the good lord heh four more weeks......i am really looking forward to this summer......well i am really looking forward to not going to PSTCC anymore awww you know i'm taking a class there next month via the internet? nope coming home for the weekend "cool, i didn't know that.....whats the class?" motorcycle safety your a dumbass HAH nah it's going to be great do you have a bike? not yet post class i am very happy your taking the class. i'm getting my tax return well yeah that will be sweet taking the class saves me from taking the test at the DMV thats also a plus right i can't wait will you be around? when is the class? First weekend in may 7-9th yeah i'll be here. thats right before the end of class do you have finals? "yeah, but i'll be around" have you taken the MCATs? "not yet, next weekend." whoa well i'll put in a prayer for you i'm gonna need all i can get i can take it in august as well. so i'm not overly stressed best way to be still sucks ass though heh have you taken a class or anything for them>? "yeah....kaplan. but i haven't had much time to prepare, with three lab courses this semester" so you're going into it on blind faith or is this a week of cramming? "i'll be reading this week, but i'm not going to kill myself" good plan i'd say its not real worth it blind faith is enough so what else is going on up north? hmmm got any big plans for the summer? just the bike maybe a few trips are you thinking about headen down to see noah at all? it's been on my list for a while last month he didn't know if he was staying "yeah, same here......i just have to find some money someplace" exactly i really do want to go my newest idea is to start looking into miami living? yup it's the cheapest city i can find so far your not searching very hard. HA well that and this is the last winter i want to see for quite some time miami would be a good choice then you just have to start loving very bright colors HEH is there a grad school down there worth going to? "oh, i don't know" i'm thinking i wont actually be in grad school until 2005 yeah......i know where your coming from. thats seems to be the best possible timeline for me as well have you picked out any choices yet? no i am honestly not real sure what a want to do. i have been thinking about dentistry lately......and all that stuff really depends on the test scores dentist! i need a damned dentist its a good life. you've got me blessing "work about 30 hours a week..........get paid about 200,000 a year.....own your own business" shit there are a lot of up sides heh plus all the perscription cocaine "my dentist works mon-thr. makes about 250, and only works about 160 days total a year" how in the hell does that work out he does what ever the fuck he wants to......pretty sweet deal he takes month long vacations "yeah, seems like my pediatric dentist was a little bit of a playboy" not much insurance problems to deal with and absolutely no call hmmmm and you could deal with people's teeth? "if i am willing to be a doctor, i could definitly be a dentist" TRUE "its essentially a medical specialty, with a lot less school" LESS school sold sign me up "no, residency. only 4 years grad program" yeah thats what i said.....so i am weighing the options right now.....this summer i am going to have to get back into a hospital to see if thats what i really want to be doing "when my time frees up, it'll be easier to make that decision" you think you'll stick around k-town? "i was trying to convince noah to go to school with me, so that we could open a practice....i'm not sure he's up for it" ha his ass is diving all day i think he'll be ok "yeah, pretty sweet life" like Noah retired already yeah....he's a step ahead of all of us only until i start sleeping on his floor for free riiight for beer i'm not sure if k-town is where i want to be.....i really need to get out for alittle bit though its starting to drive me insane heh LOL sorry but yeah something else to decide when i finish up in four weeks sounds like you need a nice long vacation to think these things over we should go visit him together drag McBroom along with us like i said i would love it.....just have to find some money yeah that would be tons of fun we'll make him drive i'll pay for gas done...sign me up have you talked with scott lately? "no, and he doesn't know that i've been thinking about visiting him either" him and Jenny are also on my list "yeah, me too i haven't been to DC since he started school" can you believe he's almost finished um NO i wonder what his plans are? seeing as how i haven't even started last i heard he was spending SB looking for a yob i need to catch up with him yup what about charles? he's back in business? he's still waiting around......doing fine though yeah.....he still has his job good deal did you get to hand out with Patrick? yeah i saw him and his girl a couple of times. he seemed to be alright.....his girlfriend is really nice she is kinda crazy crazy how? fun crazy not crazy crazy can she throw down?? owe yeah pat met her at his local bar.....she was the bartender oh haha he seems to really like japan it was good to see him.....it had been a while no kidding i'd love to still go but the interview that i had or at least one of them was basically them trying to convince us why we should NOT go and it worked thats strange....why? well the one company was like "this isn't an exchange program.. this is like any other job that just happens to be in Japan.. you're not going to get to travel and the people in Japan aren't going to ever totally accept you." and the one patrick works for was completely the opposite damn that sucks.....not very marketing i guess they get enough people who want to go that they can be like that well i guess it was a good decision then. but on the way home from my trip i just decided that i wasn't going to fuck up something that i'm really enjoying how long is the commitment? 1 year renewable yeah....i guess its no joke i think its a good call yo next month i will have been doing this for a year and after that i'm asking for a damned raise also a good call i can't beleive its been a month thats pretty crazy "tone, amanda and i are going to get some food......make sure you call me when your in town, we can go to the lake" sounds good good to talk to you enjoy yourselves tell the missus i says hey always a pleasure will do....she's reading see ya buddy tell her Salmun Rushdie has ruined my life laters alright muhhuhuuauauauahahahahahah LOL :D right? yeah im officially a dork now "careful, they follow you to bed" hahahahaha my girlfriend is gonna get jealous "LOL, yeah, it does things she won't" HAHAHAHA ahhhh wireless is good right? ill have to see if my kodak cam will work with this thing so i can do video chat it's firewire? usb should be ok if it works in iMovie iChat will pick it up auto yeah havent tried it yet my dv cam works by the by any dv cam should how did you get PENN of all places to get you one? well i work there full time as a senior it specialist i had a dell inspiron 8000 that was handed down laptop comes with the postition the dell was dead and out of warranty... sooo actually the delll was 4800 new shiT this was 3100 with penn discount you work for SAS right? they seem so prejudicial against in the literature oh yeah definitely sas is fuct up but i run things so its cool i also run some servers in engineering and classrooms throughout the university i been there 5 years so i somewhat have respect much respect i bought the G3s that the President's Center used many years ago i assume they've replaced them since then hopefully with Macs funny that the President uses them and no one else actually i just went for a job as head it support dude for the pres office i didnt get it tho "but in any case, they are a pc shop now" damn they needed pcs for certain apps i told them about ms terminal server and they had no clue i said that they coulda kept the macs i showed up their current tech person... probably why they didnt hire me :-/ ha that wouldn't surprise me in the LEAST fuck em they'll just miss all the fun i wouldn't go back if you gave me on e yup.... their loss can you put what you want on it or does it have to be legit? i can put whatever i want as long as i dont get investigated for some shit LOL HA just fix it yerself "its basically mine to use whenever and wherever, but the university owns it" that's dope so when i leave... they could opt to do it i wish the U had paid for mine anyways hahahah hey i gotta run if you need anything for it ill chat later lemme know k laters excellent i will thanks mang np what's up HEY What's up? what's up not much at a friends house in south philly I just yelled at twenty kids who were at my front door and I told them to leave. awww they were throwing a party on your doorstep? yes it was obnoxious freshman art fags I'm a CCP Freshman I don't need there art fag bullshit i'm an art fag I have enough drama in my life and I'm moving again. moving?

what ya paint my room i wondered if i would hear from you did you enjoy the other night? well i figured i would im u since u obviously weren't iming me ;-) no i did not enjoy it i had a rotten time and you were the worst person i ever slept with in my whole lifetime ;-) j/k yes i had a good time u if u can't tell im a smartass i particularly liked putting you to sleep thanks for cluing me in "btw, i can give it right back" are you going out tonight?\ nope going to bed shortly with anyone fun? i'll send that joke back to the writers of course im a blast ;-) "well, pencil me in for a blasting sometime" "although, i think i'd prefer it from your head" at least at first did you watch last night's debate? yes clips much better than last one who did they say won though the new york times is calling it a draw i think so bush won then ny times is so fucking liberal bush came a little unglued it would take a miracle to have them give it to bush ha TRUE "although, he did scream for more than a few minutes" it was interesting to watch what u paint right now i'm painting the walls in my room with their undercoat i haven't painted a portrait in a few years and i am seriously covered in paint the colors came out well tomorrow is glaze and trim so u paint i sculpt and i draw more than i paint but yes u paint walls those too well? better than most u like doing it i like designing it "painting is ok, but it's really watching the design come together that keeps me going" my mother paints faux finishes for a living no i meant like walls like living room wallks bedroom walls right that's what she does she gets more into glazing sponge painting textures i'm doing some of that with my room u can design pick out colors for homes yes ok and i am being serious here "i would pay you to come and pick out colors for my kitchen, living room/dining room, hallway, office, and bedroom and to paint it" i have not one artisitc bone in my body god ripped me of that gay trait that sounds reasonable.. you first need to decide if you like my style i can design well but i design what i like mostly im just talking colors and paint right nothing fancy i don't even know if colors match lol heh colorcell.com lol http://colorcell.uneven.org/index2.php computers can't even help me how will i know if it goes with my bed mostly no or sofa or tables or pictures so confusing my stepfather paints everything a shade of tan neutrals go with everything but depends on how spicy you like to be in most cases i'm not very stingy with color anyway i'd have to look at your house again so u would look at my hosue and not me this time ;-) that depends on how good you are at not distracting me but seriously how much would that cost me for 5 rooms including cost of paint i have no clue "basic paint and trim without a lot of fancy shit is $50-80 per room prom, my mother charges anywhere from $350 - $1200 per room depending on what kind of finish you like" although i just spent over $160 on paint for my bedroom what u mean by finish "there are processes you can apply to the walls to make them have metallic crackle, or look like leather, or look like denim, or have a stone finish" or sponge them to look like clouds jesus so complicated ;-) a bit the first thing we do is look at your house the second thing we do is go to Lowe Lowe's and look at swatches have you fallen asleep on me again? no did i last time i took an ambien so very hazy i used to eat those and you did how much do you have set aside for painting your house? $0 lol i need to know how much then i will get it if i feel it is worth it i jsut want it done before xmas i'm getting mine done for our halloween party i docorate for xmas on nov 1 "if you're free the friday before halloween, you should drop by" oh wow im an xmas freak are your family as well? no just me how did that happen? i just love it lvoe the music the decorations the tree the mood of people the shoppiong the giving the getting etc etc i gave up Christmas NO u can't do that I have last year was it for me no more why i don't understand family issues mostly. it has never really been a pleasant experience. i give people things throughout the year instead its not about the gifts its about cookies and trees and lights and decoprations and teh spirit of givin "more than that, i think i expect the people you love to come together during the season" yes friends and everythin christmas just doesn't happen for me my grandfather died on christmas but that's not why i quit it's just an example of how christmas is for me i think it's a fine concept to carry with you as much as possible i love christmas my favorite day of yearr i'm definitely a halloween person or beltane do you play santa claus? yes i do believe it or not i believe it i go to all the poor kids homes and deliver presetns every year your are thoughtful where u live again "13th and rodman, between south and lombard" gotya well i think i am about to hit the bed "ok, i will as well after i finish this wall. sleep well." ku too xoxo oops wrong person hi bobby hey hone y how ru decent home for the day what's up with you?

hi hi babe what's up? not much u i've been thinking about your house you really want to paint it? yes but i didn't realize how much it could cost i may have to wait til after christmas maybe the living room before hand though just not the whole house right away "I was thinking I could do the whole thing for $2000, but if you want to just do the living room, then it would be much cheaper" what were ya thinking $2000 plus materials or $2500 materials included how much w/ materials do you think for my room downstairs 100 - 150 maybe less i usually end up spending over a hundred on a room put it this way figure 30 - 40 for brushes and tape and shiza $20 per gallon 20 - 30 per gallon X 2 gallons for the walls 1 for the trim if it's a different color 1 for the cieling if its a different color although your downstairs would look hot with a kind of sand finish to it but that's outside of the equation lol u crack me up i have no idea it could be so complex "yeah, it's a process" the good part is that i already have a lot of stuff that you would need plus i may end up getting a sprayer :-) but anyway what is a sprayer you suggest something to me and i can't stop thinking about it "a sprayer is this machine you use to get the paint really smooth. used instead of a roller, and is much quicker in the long run" lol well you will have to come over and tell me what you think like colors and stuff cause i really have no clue oh ok no problem. we'll do it over martinis have you plans for the weekend yet?

"at the moment, no" are you asking about anything specific? nope i guess scott finished the program? never finished did he come up with a version good enough to ship? that's always negotiable as well you'd have to speak with him for the latest i know we are in the process of re-defining the way features are spec'd out ok and that i have a programmer coming in tomorrow to discuss work whoa do you know if Beryl's people came up with a box they liked? i do not did you know they were going to try? nope you'd have to speak with jason something about putting children's faces on the kite i called jason i'm going to try to find a mouse today mikey mikey dan do you have the graphic for the help button i'm sure i do "the one that says ""help" in idle state you want me to find it? if you could scott doesn't have it at this point are you with him? yse yes i left him a message earlier... i need to speak with him about that whole issue in general want me to call you? and hand you off to him sure thanks # 8568456586 Let me know when you are ready to talk ok shoot i assume you are working on the 3rd states for scott? yup ok.... that's good I'm not sure if scott explained all he needs as i understand it... "he needs the 3rd states.... including the 2 states for the new ""help"" button" yup "also.... a ""more"" button for the Learning bar (3 states)" k ETA? "end of day today into tomorrow, depending on whether jason calls about other stuff" such as? the box "as far as I know, he shouldn't be calling you,,, I should be your contact from now on........" ha i know i know i know i can't stop trying to do it right tho and i had a meeting with those three i think it finally made sense "they keep complaining about lag time this,,, lag time that... and i laid it out for them" OR-GAN-I-ZA-TION esp in terms of contracting out programming... we need to have plans of attack anyway "not to throw a wrench in the works, but.. i get more done when jason directs what i'm doing, because by the end of our conversations what and when is very clear to both of us, and he's less likely to change it down the line" many points related to that fact when did you have this meeting? i forget which day exactly earlier this week i believe... maybe end of last week "for whatever reason, there's much less confusion when jason is the only person supervising my work. we've been doing this long enough for me to guage that, but if we're going back to a different way of doing it, then i need to know exactly where to get my answers from" right... proceed as is for now then... I'll update you later "i see your point, and i don't want to change things until i am more confident that the new method will work at least as well" which entails a follow-up conversation with Jason right i have a request shoot dvd cover.... yes? obviously i just talked to sameer... i know that the version you have right now is 100mb is it possible to create a smaller version so we can print there should be one on a disc at the office the file size itself won't get much smaller we also need the email screenshot replaced that whole project is about 3rd on my list how was the disc labeleed no idea nevermind i found some already printed sorry to bother ok I'd like to speak with you and jason... when can you come into the office next? probably tomorrow "alright, i have a meeting here at 3" k so.... if you could be here tomorrow afternoon so we could meet before or after that time k sweet headphones came in the other day right been using the iPod FINALLY you like it? oh yeah all i knew it to be great nice to have my own theme music while in transit now ha have you seen that episode of family guy? nope what is it? peter is granted 3 wishes or something like that... one of them is his own theme music hA "so he whenever he moves, etc... he has different songs that play" images of him skipping with shopping bags.... on the bus... etc... that's funny hilarious.... brb i just bought this: "http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=3,CONTENTID=7110" nice who's in charge of paying us these days? me/jason/scott ok something to talk about tomorrow ok i think there's a check from last week that i need to pick up be back in a bit.. have to go pick up a computer right ok a $100 mouse? a $100 wireless mouse man that's some craziness no wires it's a magic mouse haah i got it paired up with my powerbook and it's rechargable via the blue tooth? yup wow what do you hook up to the computer? nothing built in so you never have to charge it you just use it and its all good? it's got a docking station to charge it with but the charge lasts for ~ 3 days ahhh ok i thought it would magically charge too now that would be hot i would pay $200 for that fur real see you tomorrow i'm outta here laters in office/ ? yup awesome you know that printer's that we went to to look for paper? yes ? 6 fire trucks burnt ? upstairs was crazy i'm guessing downstairs was dowsed that sucks eh can anyone say insurance? where are you? in bed just woke up ok i'll talk to you after you have got yourself together the ftp server is still down yeah everything is down except simplec do they have an internet connection in the office? i can put the buttons on my ftp in the meantime www.smilingscreens.com does that work? no yes. put them on your ftp gonzo is emailing us all with instructions for the simplec ftp weird it looks like my server is down too ok so what's up "well, hopefully by the end of the day one of them will be working... i think the simplec ftp is working, i just don't have the instructions yet" you are finished with the 3rd states? yes it took me like an extra 14 hours over the weekend so i didn't get to anything else on the list hte QRG - Jason said that he had mocked up some changes to the alarm section on a copy of the QRG at your place and left it with you there and i told him that those changes were only one page and he needed to come up with more when are you in the office next i haven't thought about it really "alright, well i think it would be best if we could work on it in person" "or i can pick up a copy of the QRG this afternoon, look it over and tell you from there" ok i just don't have one in front of me to reference at the moment it was something like he wanted to explain the four kinds of circles in the calendar blah blah something or other yeah i know exactly what should be there i just don't have a copy to reference space and what not "so, table that for now... I'll have to get back to you on that one" ok next on the list is the Brocure brochure the blue one right but not change it as you like ok "main point is, new screenshot" as soon as possible are you sure the dvd cover isn't the next on the list? same time both the brochure and dvd cover go out in mailings that need to be sent asap they both need new screenshots right so you can put them next to each other on the list ok it should be fairly simple to do Jason did not get you a copy of the Beginner's manual ? good "not that i know of, but as of this morning my mail server is down" right.. you can use smilingscreens.com/email instead of www.smilingscreens.com/email it is slow as shit tho k to be fixed this afternoon when gonzo has access to scott's place to bypass the crappy wireless router our server is on a wireless router? exactly exactly it took a genius to tell gonzo to bypass that shit and just plug the dsl into the server me being the genius anyway <sigh> "yes mikey, i know" ok so brochure and dvd thing today let me know when you have them done ok what is your estimate i think i'm going to redo them in InDesign probably end of the day as long as they are printable from the office sur ee I plan on having the QRG and Beginner's manual for you by the end of the day ok have you seen the organizational video? this is the one that adam did? yes i have a copy of it here but i haven't watched it ok we are going to need a cd label for that as well a cd label? (we are going to burn it to cd) so we can send to people to watch on their computers via WMA a fancy label or a black and white label time difference ? like an hour vs 3 MAYBE on the outside we'll make that decision when we come to it on the list unless you need to plan it now nah alright... so for now... brochure and dvd label...... coming next should be QRG and Beginners.... video cd label last do you need anything from me ? do you know which brochure had the misspelled words? did we fix that already i believe that was fixed in the blue version i'm checking now shit taking too long i've got them on here i'm nearly positive that the blue one was after i revised i can look ok well that was a while ago "http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,62826,00.html" jeeeezzzusss exactly idiots and someone is getting paid by these idiots actual money for nothing $10000 in one month yeah so we have no excuse different idiots matters not business is business we need different idiots "alright,,, i'm off to the office" talk to you in about 30 for some reason ????????? the quotes don't fit on the brochure in indesign great more software compatibility issues um i'll figure it out alright talk to you i a bit i know why the size is only 10 pt ok laters ah laters do you have jason's proposed edits to the qrg ? possibly they went with to boston "i would appreciate it if you could find them, as i would like to have an idea as to what he proposed" "if not, that's fine too" i can make it up i'll go upstairs and check thanks i think they got tossed yesterday "oh, and like a dumbass, i just imported that cd of music you gave me... i didn't save it ot my hd" alright i'lll work with what i got "so, itunes has the list of songs, just no songs to reference" awesome yeah i'm an idiot anyway... i'll have to catch up with that when i see you next i need new music i also need to go through all my music and clean it again basically i got rid of all of my music and stole everyone elses so i can find what i like of theirs and start over damn "alriught,, i have to shut down to install simplec" talk to you in a sec k "alright, i have an idea for the date shit" whenever you are ready ? I'm looking at pages 31-33 with me? just 32 and 33 31 stays absolutely correct so... "on 31, section off into Intermediate and Advanced" Alarm is in Intermediate Recurrence is in Advanced k description of each next to the button images 33... zoom in on one date within DATE for? "on this particular date, you will have one each of the four types of items (regular circle for a regular entry, clock for alarm entry, clockwise arrow for recurrence, and clock and cockwise arrow for an alarm with a recurrence)" that's all fine except for the part of blowing the day up you can show each as an example without the screenshot because in this particular case the screenshot will look awful excellent just as long as it is clear that they are entries in a date and not just the buttons maybe have sample text next to them will that work? sure send me the text ok working on that now ready for some text? i'm not going to get to it until tomorrow at least but you're welcome to send it "i think i want to get rid of the ""side bar"" and ""top bar"" parts of the inside of the brochure" and replace them with what blank space get rid of the side bar and top bar images ? or text ? text how will you make up for their absense ce what do you mean? now that i look at it the information is awkward we display descriptions or details for the six applications "aside from that, only help and email" it doesn't lay out well the way it is alright.. do one copy with text as is do one laid out how you see fit easy enough? no that doesn't solve my problem because i still have to find a way to lay it out with the text the way it is if i could find a way to do it you can't just use a new screenshot? then there's no need to get rid of it and leave everything else the same ? no everything is conforming to one style the box the qrg this and teh dvd cover that's why this is taking all day i have the outside finished and the inside is mostly finished of the brochure? except for this one problem yes you are still using a full page screenshot yes? yes do some quick mock ups and let me preview does that help at all? not really forget it i'll figure something out the problem with taht is that you may cut something that shoujldn't be cut i'm not going to cut anything ok I don't mind working on the text if you need it shorter in places let me know if i can help k thanks "i know that doesn't help you for shit.... but i don't have a good idea at present.... one that would preserve the brochure noting all six apps, and highlighting teh other important features" it's fine i think i've got something ok "ok, i'm not fooling with it anymore today" alright what about the dvd label? the label for which? the dvd case that's what i'll look at next "ok, so you are working on brochure and dvd case label now?" basically and they will be done when? they'll be ready to print and look at maybe tomorrow the brochure is ready for a print i haven't started the dvd cover yet "alright, i assume the brochure is too big to transfer/" ? I need to print both and send out end of day tomorrow at latest use what we have there should be many copies already printed the point is I am waiting for new ones before I send out they have old screen shots did you receive gonzo's email re: ftp? "i got one about the email, but nothing about the ftp" "Please remove any materials that you might have saved in the gambit design ftp site. As a replacement, use the www.simplec.com as your ftp server, i.e. follow the instructions that I previously sent out but use www.simplec.com instead of www.smilingscreens.com." l k do you have the instructions??? else I will have gonzo forward them to you please do is there anything else you need from gonzo i'm drafting an email now not that i'm aware of ok you should have the FTP instructions shortly great are you in the office today? no will you have time to speak on the phone sometime this afternoon? yes excellent need anything further from me? still working on brochure and dvd label? just the dvd cover and what about your business cards? i saw the ones on tutos they are useless old w/ old info outdated but not useless well i couldn't modify them they could have been changed easily in an emergency you are correct i could have replaced all the text I'm less worried about that to tell you the truth.... I'm going to set up a secure storage area to store physical media k and I'm going to get together all of our printed materials and i'll probably need your help with some of it k but i'm going to put together a comprehensive resource for SSI materials all printable from the office "that way, when someone asks 1.5 hrs before they leave, i can use one finger to point and say, ""there it is" I didn't have the time to sit and modify the bcards i asked him two weeks ago if he needed any yeah i'm sure i did too "at this point, it doesn't matter, i have my solution to all these sorts of problems" and i will be working on it this afternoon its all part of my quest for actually organizing ssi how fast is your connection from home? dsl whatever that is when are you in the office next? end of the week does your powerbook support cdrw's? yes awesome.. "I want to get everything we have off Tutos and your powerbook and anywhere else it may reside, and put the most recent versions of each item on CD" k "as they change, replace them, archiving the old" so i guess CDRW is irrelevent.... but you get the idea yes any way to view the new brochure? yes i'm excited for new colors what did you find out about InBooklet? it's $100 and it allows you to do lots of shit serial #? that i was unable to find actually what version are you working with? 3 damnit yeah i found the 2.1.2 as did i let me get my laptop up I like it a lot i like it better the method you use to highlight sections is growing on me i think it work really well inside the screenshot for now it does those old people look really really corny they scare me the guy looks like a manatee brb k I am away from my computer right now. back k How long is Jason gone for? should be back tomorrow hwy i think anwyay why "we talked about replacing the screenshot on the dvd cover with the one we used on the box, and i'm wondering how much of the text he wants to pull over with it" is there a box sample in the office? only if jason brought it back from his meeting can I otherwise see what you are referencing? yes but i've already changed it it's done then yes brochure and dvd case are done no we need a temporary alternative to the solitaire screenshot that's on the back of dvd cover to serve until scott has had a change to put in the three button states ok i'mat th eoffice now let me have a look at the current shot "i'm going to say the web, because it's the easiest to reproduce" with what website ??? ours eh i wouldn't do that ha cause it will change well you know??!!?? it's only temporary anyway i don't think it will look good in its current state you can do whatever you see fit what are you speaking of? dvd case what don't you think will look good the simplec website i picked something else but why not because the buttons that currently reside on the index page are fucked up ah i'm in the process of getting that shit fixed its all screwed up no more changes to that website before they are reviewed i gave gonzo new buttons weeks ago none of this has anything to do wit hyou yeah he changed them but the way they fit on the page he didn't use the right buttons and changes like these are supposed to be cleared by me before they go live because you're right now that i'm looking at this it looks like shit so WHY esp if you minimize horizontally wasn't i asked about this right this is all why i am stepping in i don't know who cleared those buttons i know i came in one day and they were there alright i just told gonzo to always put such changes on a non-live location regardless of who suggests them "and that they must be reviewed by all, esp you, before putting them up live" who suggested to them sameer and jason i want a name and address you know where you can find both that site is a motherfucking disaster right now "ok, what do you suggest" from this point gonzo is working on changes as we speak take what's there OFF until we come up with an agreeable solution and put what up/ ? nothing better nothing than something awful i gave him those fucking buttons WEEKS ago there were supposed to be three Not five he has three sizes to choose from there are four he knows *exactly* the way they were supposed to show up alright here's the deal i'm going to have him take down all the buttons why is it that we have a menu at the top AND buttons at the bottom anyway irght buttons gone in a few min can I call you? yes 8xx xxx xxxx 8568456586 www.simplec.com/indextest.php "better layout, wrong buttons" ok what buttons do you suggest he has the buttons i want gonzo said he is aware of the black buttons the on overs and the corresponding mouseoffs is that what you wanted? they're all together they're different than what's there do then have the simplec logo on them? no "ok, so gonzo has the states" yes but the text needs to be put on all the buttons fine he does that white buttons red text mouseoff black buttons white text mouseover he does not have the same font as used in the menu is the text font that is on the buttons currently ok? yes its arial no the whole site should be... wait for it.. what gzo used for those buttons is arial ok "the understanding here is that all text that is actually an image,, (menu, buttons, logo, etc) should be the optima or whatever font it is that you used" "and that the text that is just text,,, is arial" no ok advise the entire site all text should be helvetica the text in the menu is optima the text over the buttons he uses here should be verdana ok "as far as i know, he rewrote all of the buttons with text overlays" they are now all images if not verdana then helvetica if not that geneva if not that arial that's the way the stylesheet was originally written when i gave it to him if there are going to be four buttons they need to be spaced a little farther from the text and each other good point i don't like them center aligned but without descriptions they won't work that well left aligned i still don't understand the use of buttons instead of the menu really i don't understand the use of buttons when text will work just find fine as it does in the rest of the site REALLY i just want to redo the whole fucking thing the dvd cover is done ok fuck it tell gonzo to get rid of the buttons and make them text links like everything else if they want more prominence then put it in the fucking menu these buttons suck my cock the user site is supposed to use those same buttons by the way right but i'm not worried if he hasn't had time to change them right the objective was "to add the ""showcasing"" of simplec functionality" "in particular, the email function" "so that visitors could ""preview"" simpleC" fine whatever i'm not sure how you would put the email demo in the menu text works just as well "maybe a ""DEMO"" section" "and a ""TOUR"" section" we used to have a demo section both menu items i know red text with descriptions or menu items you pick no buttons until this can be revisited ok in the right way done i'll make a decision between the two "if i do text with descriptions, do you want a vertical list ?" yes in exactly the same way as the trial page "One Page SimpleC Tour blah blah blah blah blahblahjb lakhblakj blkaj SimpleC Email blah lbhalbk halkhb lakj blkaj;lkbj a;lk TITLE lakjb;lakj;xlkbajs;ldkjsal;ksjd" next to each other in a table yes i see speaking of which that page needs to be fixed to SIMPLEC EMAIL blah blah blahb albha lbahl b what is wrong with that page? "the ""*10 day Trial Version"" looks lost" ok advise smaller text not bolded same area? fuck that or move it closer just put it at the top with the rest of the text Try SimpleC free for 10 days whatever below the download links "ok, smaller, no bold, below download links" or have a couple sentences explaining the links the asterix is ludicrous with as little text as it applies to do you see what i'm saying? yes.... make it look like the contact page so just put that detail in the description fine right? yes "fuck it,, i'll just make it exactly like the contact pagde" page yeah ? still in a table bold headline then links next to descriptions right enough of this same format for the index page crap yes sweet enough of this thanks for going over it with me so do you want the brochure and the dvd cover yes please how many people are you going to try to send them to today? i only have two myself.... but jason has many... i don't know exactly how many he is back here tonight would you send them today if i gave them to you or would you wait until tomorrow "i would send to my contacts today, but I CAN wait until tomorrow if that is better" "you can send two copies, but i want to print them out and look at them myself before we send any more than that" he never sent me the beginners manual "ok,, here's teh deal, I have these two facilities that I would like to send this information to as soon as I can... people I talked to last week.... I can wait for you to make sure that these are ""kosher"" if you can do so early tomorrow" "yeah, i'm thinking about coming in tomorrow" that would be super depends on the rain we could all get wriled up and wrestle but right now it should be fine in lieu of beginners manual QRG? done wait not done hehe why not i was going to ask you if that alarm info fit correctly i haven't looked at it ok... the descriptions for the alarm and recurrence button can lose some of the description if need be let me know when you have looked at it. I'm sure you'll have some better suggestions than what i gave you k' does scott know that the buttons are posted? "when you are in tomorrow, we will have all the resources I need to yes" yes he does "when you are in tomorrow, we will have all the resources I need to compile a comprehensive list of printed resources on CD?" you'll have everything that's in the state it's in on my computer perfect only the first sentence of the button descriptions are useful where? the stuff you wrote up for alarm right chop it zamer added more it's still only a page even if you do examples for the clock clock wise arrow and etc? yes you know what i say? i bet you can guess fuck it? fuck it it's fine alarms are more useful than recurrence at least at a beginner level it's fine if we did a page on alarm and a page on recurrence? won't fit in such a way that it follows the rest of the guide we don't go over searching or spell check either http://www.simplec.com/indextest.php refresh move the NO PREVIOUS COMPUTER EXPERIENCE up with the line of text it reads off and it's fine much much much better don't you think? dude... those fucking buttons were pissing me off from day one when they were all mis aligned and shit its SIMPLE i just talked to jason a while ago and i chose to piss him off by telling him i had taken all the buttons off completely ha he got himself worked up for a minute "i want those buttons, i want that functionality.. something is better than nothing... wah wah wah" yo i'm more than willing to have that discussion I took a shot for you.... making the point of reviewing the crap before putting it up thanks dude... its proper procedure anyway.... i'll work with gonzo to make the changes k thanks for the input you may want to reorder the list to put the tours together but whatever it looks find right fine "no, i agree" that was gzo's first cut tours first or last? what order would you put them in? email first tours last why not "Email, Tutorial, One Page, Detailed" yes right i talked to Seth a few minutes ago yeah? how's he? well moving to a house i hope have you and maria scheduled a trip? maria can't go i'm going to hook it up after i get my tax return speaking of which you need to fill me in on used motorcycles japanese honda? before we get into that... on the trial page yes?

"zamer, me, scott, roxana, sameer, you," gzo are you asking about which people should have them available to print? ye s as in for whom you should make templates ok oh.. adam leon do you need any information for any of those people? yes what? adam leon same contact info as everyone adam@smilingscreens.com "for the QRG, can we just use that one page of alarm stuff and add a page elsewhere?" problematic shifts the pages to opposite sides cell phone for adam> ? 917 593 4516 who's going to cut this shit? Adam's title? VP PR each person can cut their own haha the problem is that we cannot have a printer cut it in a machine because our printer doesn't print consistently mmhm have we tried? no should i be telling david what we're up to? peck? yes he does not work with us anymore right well he's asking you can tell him to eat shit for all i care just kidding what is he asking "him - how is stuff at smiling screens? me - business as usual him - cool me - anything big on the horizon him - not my business to know" wait reverse the last two right eh seems harmless i wouldn't worry about it unless you start giving away company secrets hahah what's considered a secret these days? what time sameer gets up inthe morning lol you know damned well that i ignore sameer i'm quite aware "well, i think its easy to assume taht you would only know what you are doing in the graphics arena" it's a creative way of interpreting my contract right and I don't think that anything you would divulge in terms of that could be damaging to the company #1 "i'm a leary SOB, i would probably be very terse with him" peck knows that i don't like him so why is he asking ME right that's why i wouldn't tell him shit he's gone fuck him weird kid yeah quitter ha he quit? or we fired? eh dissolved "we agreed to break up" hahaha god alright back to QRG yes? leave it be seriously that's unnecessary drama right there "so, the first page of DATE is a date screenshot with the alarm and recurrence button at the bottom" um no t that i know o f i was thinking then we could have one page section on alarm and recurrence and a one page section of appointment descriptions page 31 step one is a shot of the DATE button step 2 is a fullscreen shot of DATE yeah "so, i was thikning that 32 or 33 would be the alarm and recurrence section... and the other page the appointment types section" all of that will fit on one page given the size of everything else in the guide can we spread it over two?> or 1.5 add in the bar that the buttons are on and add a shot of the date that the appointments would be in i dunno... just trying to think i just want it finished it's finished and it has to include recurrences nah plus my copy of inbooklet expired so if you want to change it you have to buy the thing alrighty then.. what you crankin on now replacing the business cards on tutos ok label for the video cd mmh m "Bcards Doc Templates (fax, memos, etc) Brochure DVD case label CD labels (trial, full version) Video CD label VHS label QRG Beginner Manual Order Forms Letters (to organizations, individuals, etc)" that's my list for printed materials i want on cds in the office and on tutos FYI "not done: CD labels, Video CD label, VHS Label, Beginners Manual, Order Forms" ok http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/5/36649.html yeah i saw that coming fuckem... i'm on my bike most of the time it's a good point tho shit i've thought about bustin somebody esp those helpless lil kids walkin around with those idiotic painful headphones that come with the ipod at least mine don't cause me PAIN but they're still white you gonna mug me? bring it bithc lol ha over my dead body "alright,,, well, i think we at least got a few things done today" the QRG is going to cause jason to bitch jason can eat me slowly is there no way to edit it without inbooklet ? um i'm going to say no i think its pretty fucked up to have alarm and not recurrence recurrence exists somewhere it's just 6 pages 6 pages what? 6 pages to explain how to make a recurrence in the same way that everything else is explained and again we don't have spell check or search it's supposed to be a quick guide not a damned manual in light of that..... don't explain how to set an alarem just show the button say what it does same thing with recurrence and then explain the appointment icons and that's one page leave the other fucker black blank or orange or stretch it put another screen shot it i don't care see if scott wants to buy that program inBooklet? yes fuck there has to be a way around it other software or something there's one alternative you know how tight we are that doesn't work as well alright lemme ask i feel like i'm asking my dad for a playstation ask for that too he'll give in on the software leave the booklet as it is until further notice we'll leave it up to jason i agree with you.. that its a qrg not an indepth explanation tabled for now i found it for $50 http://www.adobe.com/store/products/plugIn.jhtml?id=catPlugins_Adbe_IDSN_PMKR we're going to need it if we are to make any changes pretty much and for anything else we do like this right buy it actually when you come in tomorrow we will buy it ok solved i have to write up the description for those four things on teh index page mmhm "ok, so once you are done with the bcards..." the next thing would be video cd label done with the bcards ok then any of the items you said were not yet done how is it getting packaged cd label packaged? what's it being sent in/with when ? this week? in general you mean the video cd specifically how it is being packageed right i would assume in a clear sleeve jobby with what else? does it go in the box? specifically no is it going to be shipped with the software? this is for organizations yes it will be but that software will be in dvd cases better to have the labels be distinct we wouldn't ship retail boxes to senior facilities "right.... sorta like... ""look at our cool video.... we're so special" "you know you want to be a part of this.." brb k do you think i could ride a bike to Tennessee? motorcycle? no YES i didn't know if you meant a 10 speed ;) yeah why couldn't you ride a bike to TN? hook my ass up with a satellite phone lol i dunno cuz it's a 1000 miles there an back 500 one way? 560 something like that you'd ahve to take 4 breaks 4 sets of breaks? one way trip to TN would require at least 4 rest stops OH yeah or kittycrack i mean just physcially getting the bike there you don't want to be on a bike for more than an hour usually so i can register it well shit it takes 10 hours "ah, you mean without plates?" or a license probably would still have plates you have to work pretty hard to get pulled over on a bike usually "like,,, go 120 or something" cops just don't want the risk but it's possible to ride that far without having to mess with the mechanics "depending on the bike,, yes" what kind of bike would it tkae? just one in decent shape fuel injected bikes are far more reliable more expensive..... too what about a 1991 Honda Nighthawk 250cc? not fuel injected shit http://philadelphia.craigslist.org/mcy/27492379.html how much did you want to spend? less than that if possible really i want something that will get me to philly and back during the summer and i can't deal with a car bikes are very dangerous and i like you being alive therefore i don't recommend dammit segways don't go far enough haha but they are really cool i saw one at the 76ers game the other night that stupid bunny came out on it Ha and was shooting tshirts with a gun that segway was movin yeah? oh yeah it was cool i just sat there and stared at it i'd get to the middle of the bridge and need to charge it yeah that would suck how many miles? hmmmm less than 20 get a road bike Please a rickshaw and an immigrant maybe http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=10062&item=2468548811 wicked see that's the goal but fuck if i've ever touched a motorcycle before yeah they are very problematic i want it why are the fuel injectors better? because carbeurators suck ass "they rely on atmospheric pressure and ""float"" bubbles, etc" fuel injectors are electronic and consistent this is to get the thing started? this is what delivers the fuel into the combustion chamber so what's like the basic bike that has this? they are too expensive for you forget it ok so what should i look at instead an immigrant with a large backpack LOL stop i don't kno wwhy i just found that so funny i do asshat just ignore the fact that i'm a questionable driver for the moment and pick one honda's right suzukis k yamaha even any particular model? but it will be a bitch what will "for you, i would recommend something 250cc" "the carbeurators, etc" k you'djust have to get it checked out before taking a long trip 250cc bikes are smaller and will be the most likely to give you the foot reach you need and less weight to hold up right ok... i'm going to see if i can make a deal for a playstation i need something on the small side i'll be back in a few minutes a deal where ? at game champ good luck a small store on 16th and chestnut get it for less than $130 not possible shite i am lucky to get the station an extra controller and the game i want for 180 tell them it has to be less than $150 i'm def going to mention the xbox going down in price fucking you might as well wait if it isn't alright...we'll see brb k crap closed? nah well yeah negotiations closed what ha did you call? no i walked over there nothing? nussing bitches how much was it>? 180 20 for the game 24 for the extra controller 180 plus 20 plus 24? 180 for the ps2 20 for GT3 FUCK that shit that's what it costs NEW yweah that's what i was buying numbnuts Why do you want a new one? don't want to mess with used lasers the don't have like a year warranty or some shit? ebay sucks i can't find what i want the Yamahas look like dirt bikes yeah i looked most of them were meh can you test something for me? sure http://www.sfs.upenn.edu/seo/php4/suplogin.php4 let me know when you are there now what i am going to give you login information rocarri2@mail.med.upenn.edu is the login Stefan is the pass let me know if you get in kj i'm in ok thanks that's all np is anyone new in the office?

"qrg, labels, box" sweet and jason sent me the first seven pages of the beginners manual right good what's up with you bored want to leave work boss is a putz at penn? "you know, the usual" yeah i want to go buy a playstation and play it all day "hey, at least you get paid" HA or ride my bike or both what time are you goign to elave? i need someone with a car to drive me to best buy i dunno.. maybe 4 is best buy cheaper? call Maria "i don't know about cheaper, but I think i'd be a little more comfortable buying from them" dont' they sell it at KMart? probably "dude, you could buy it there, play it for three months and take it back no questions asked" at kmart? yeah 30 day return mah they're not supposed to ask you any questions i know but it's 30 days not 3 months its so cool tho the console itself does not fall in the exceptions list only the games basically the only thing you can't return to kmart is media unopened media you can right but i've definitely returned things months later i guess it's easier in the suburbs have you returned gaming systems? definitely I returned a GameCube and an N64 opened? played for months that is hot i'm going to get a ps2 today ha i'm serious do it DO it do you think it is easier in cash or credit cash the entire purchase and return process why is cash better? quicker hot city that means i can take back the memory card too yup the packaging is a little tricky steam i think it comes in plastic http://www.kmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1185665&cp=784867.784878.824576.824592&page=2&pageBucket=0&parentPage=family you're right do you have any new things to show me? i put the cd labels on the ftp site i've really liked all the stuff you've done recently how do i get to that? is it easy or should i see instructions www.simplec.com user smilescreen pass 895Ks729 labelcdtemplate? yes the other two as well? yes hey hey hey what's up nada gettin excited for ps2 when are you getting it? have you seen the beginners manual? eh briefly whats up i seem to recall him saying that we didn't need illustrations to go with the text but i could be making that up for purposes of convenience because the text could definitely use illustrations really i'm wondering what he wants me to do with it i also got the impression that we were not going to do graphics on that manual k fine better for me but diagrams would probably help in the long run i agree so i laid out the qrg alarm thing and it's only a page sounds good? not good i know i was hoping can you send me that one page? there isn't a whole lot explaining that the appointment icons appear in each date do you really think there needs to be? to fill space.... yes that seems obvious to me plus right.. but i think it would be clearer to a novice if you showed them an example of where those icons appear they appear where they appear i don't know how you quantify thatt beyond what's there and anyway put a screen shot of the icons IN a date ok well or is that completely ridiculous i guess we'll wait until scott is finished i honestly don't give a shit what does it have to do with scott being finished? screenshot nevermind I don't care either i like the way you have it now the current problem is that blank page and that's all i can think of to fill it without losing functionality or being ridiculously redundant what's up partner not much lucky luke ha did you find your PS2? i don't even want to talk about it for now HA ok anyway whatcha doin seein if you got gzo's email about? asking you if you are completely off the gambitdesign ftp no but yes you are we talked about it yesterday you and gzo? wednesday yes alright don't worry about responding to his email ok i'm goign to tell him to kill it right now i didn't get it what are you workin on? beginners manual but i'm pretty close to being done with what he gave me sounds good what was the password to the simplec ftp? 895Ks729 nice thanks do you know where the three stooges are? not the foggiest what do you need? gonzo and i want to get paid actually are you in the office? it's not a big deal for me yes but it would save me the hassle of coming back into the city right what time are you there until? until it becomes apparent that no one else is showing up and i run out of things to do I will be there around 5 ok and if you guys don't have checks by then i'll get them to you great thanks and then we can go buy a PS2 "i don't want you guys to have to deal with late checks, ever" i'm sick of that shit well hey that makes two of us iknow "ok, so the ps2" you went i went to Kmart after work and? i asked she pointed no ps2 fuck "oh, someone must have bought the last one" :( you bitch that's cuz they know they can take that shit back best buy's return policy is deceptive and stupid yeah so i'm left waiting until ghettomart gets another ps2 shipment ha did they have any idea when that was? no right they get shipments daily but don't know when a ps2 will be on those shipments fucking brilliant naturalkly you know we live in the fourth largest city in the United States "wait,, youare in the office?" I find it hard to believe there are no acceptable places to buy what is a pretty common consumable yes walk over to gzo and tell him to kill gambitdesign in the office he disappeared but i'll tell him alright i emailed him tooo "yeah, i agree with you about the fourth largest city shit" i forgot my mouse what is there left to do you have everything up to date? all printed materials? i think so box? yeah i forgot my mouse you have a final mock-up of the box ready to be presented ? no so you are saying that you can't work on anything without your mouse? i can just hopefully not the box the box right now is a problem why depth perception lots of reason s but the old fuckers in the background the kite inthe fore i don't know what to tell you.... it's really not that simple the kite was supposed to be the centerpiece yeah that's a problem too "if the concept is impossible, then we need to switch to a new one as soon as possible" "probably not impossible, but it needs to cook in the back of my head for a while" "the only idea i would have would be putting SimpleC in the upper left, the kite in the fore upper right with string to the people or chair in the lower left background, and whatever wording in the lower right" that's the idea but the angle at which your eye sees the kite in relation to the grass in relation to the chair in relation to the people (if there are even people) is precise and difficult to achieve gotcha the cd label is too red can we inverse that? yeah i thought it might be we can but it's going to look exactly like the video cd "did jason not say to have the video cd read ""SimpleC Smiling Screens Case Study""??" "just curious because in the video it says ""Smiling Screens Case Study" it says SimpleC Case study in the video? i haven't seen the video that's what i'm referring to in the video it says Smiling Screens Case Study would he rather use the Smiling Screens logo? no then as far as I'm concerned it's SimpleC i think it is important to tie it to simplec what do you think that's what i think i think that if we're going to tie in Smiling Screens then we need to talk about how they relate to each other because the idea is that we are/will send this video along with all other SimpleC materials to an assisted living or other senior care facility we've never done that before what i really thing think is that the video is mistitled because up to now how SimpleC and Smiling Screens relate to each other? "we were minimizing ""Smiling Screens"" right out of the picture" well put it this way the only way it makes sense to me is that Smiling Screens is the company that produces simplec "the SimpleC logo never gets associated with anything but ""SimpleC" and smiling screens was the company that executed the study "if he wants ""Smiling Screens Case Study" then we use the Smiling Screens logo then we use SSI logo i want to talk to Jason about it in your opinion... do you think the oganizations we would send this to would be able to make the connection? i have no way of gauging that but you can give me your opinion "well, i seem to be constantly overestimating the intelligence of the average person, but really, i don't see why not" "i think as long as we include a letter printed on SSI letterhead mentioning ""our product, simpleC" it should be cleaer k i'd have to watch the video one more time to see how much simplec and ssi are mentioned i'm not going to fool with it right now brb that's agreeable k so what now "so, box is out" pretty much vid cd label is out yes i'm going to help gonzo with a video alright smilingscreens email and tutos are worthless so damn slow i haven't been using them yeah i'm moving away from it patheti c forward your email do i do that through hotmail or ss email ss email have gonzo change it to a forwarding account werd i just called Kmart and> ? apparently they have PS2 in stock "so," riiiight go now NOW that either means that they lied to me today NOW NOW NOW or yesterday or go ! they got in a shipment today eh i have to wait GO! i'll go later go NOW! anyone show up to pay you fools? they won't have it when you get there everyone is here no one has gotten paid scott is there? yes go ask him for a check got ti thanks are you coming? who in KMart told you they have PS2s? electronics department i heard her yell at someone asking if there were any there 179.99 plus tax werd go now i can't unfortunately responsibility be damned yeha anything interesting happening at th eoffice? did you speak with jason? no and yes did he clear anything up for you unfortunately sameer got involved so no ha what came of it then really nothing really i don't have a good answer so you are no better off now than you were not really what about with the beginner's manual? i'm not paying attention to it jason wants pictures ha so you ahve that to do now viceo video? why are you working on that because no one else can do it? ha somebody just tried to call me on my cell from the green phone scott did tell him to sign on to MSN please k how are ya i'm good happy to be back with your darling computer?] i missed it terribly but to be honest that this is HOT i'm glad you had it what's hot? that thing your computer ah yeah why are you glad i had it? my child was in good hands yeha i watched over it played maybe 2 songs off it the entire time admired the cool white-blue light when it's sleeping? yeah mezmorizing "breathing" "so, did you figure out what song i was referring to?" Natural Disaster by Fischerspooner yes can you send it to me now? how large is it? it's not 30 minutes ? 7 Mb werd office connection is garbage i was hopping my 100MBps would pull the file through ours or yours? it didn't connect? yeah its connected 14% sweet SSI offfice connectin] so what's the deal app Jason feels like shit gonzo headed to a meeting back uptown so it's just me right now i'm sort of working on the box alright everything else is done? you have the materials for SG to send out? as far as i know no brochure ok or qrg but he didn't really ask the brochure is done right? both are done as far as I thought the brochure is printable i think that i'm going to take the scary white fuckers off the front and make it look like the box the qrg is also printable but if we were going to mass produce it then i'd want to go through and finalize the spacing no time for that in this case "well, how long would it take to finalize spacing?" maybe a day maybe two not worth doing until were pretty much set on its content though and as far as i know yeah so don't worry about it for now we'll be printing it out here for the forseeable future if sam want's to spend money on 5000 or whatever "cuz it's like 5,000 for 500 copies" right that's his perogative by the by do you think we could actually compute how much we've spent on printing up to now like come up with a real per page cost? yes i know the ink costs i know the paper costs well i ahve access to them right i'm thinking you are trying to see if it actually saves us money? pretty much sameer thinks it's 20 cents a page and i'm thinking it's probably less than that "well," how many pages does the printer say we have printed? "we just changed it at the 10,000 mark right?" "well, i figured that there was a set amount for us to have printed when it needed that maintenance, so we could figure it off that" Exactly even include the cost of the maintenance 200 for the mainenance... roughly figure about 500 for ink so maybe 10 cents a page? you have to figure in that expensive ass paper Ha the glossy paper? yeah that we pay fucking $40 for 200 sheets? right $0.20 per man we could get the paper cheaper though right? might be able to cut that in half so you are talking $20 per err .20 per brochure right "ok, well at least i have a good idea" for when i print proofs i'd say that you can be comfortable with <0.40 estimate per for color that's a lot to me printing should be like 5-10 per page ideally i mean wtf do i know well we could get ink costs down by getting aftermarket we need to monitor the stripe issue i don't see us paying $10 a copy to have the qrg printed elsewhere i guess it costs us like $10 though depends on the quantity how do you figure that? 48 pages right *.2 24 pieces of paper two sides? right "so, the first side and the paper is .2" the additional side... 0.10 so its like $7.50 k but this is all estimating brb what's your password? for my laptop? yes why? punk ha so i don't have to break in again bitch ass i'm going to compress the video how did you do that by the way? ha never leave mikee bored with a computer in the room Joinme3 how did you do it? magic i see one of your loved ones regularly don't make me make threats ha you couldn't break into mine even if you were bill fucking gates that is not what i asked you dude Windows is lame you boot in safe mode and create a new account or boot from a disc figured it was something like that that's really stupid very very "if you put a login on OS X, it is basically impossible to get in without the password" i really want an apple and you can encrypt your entire hard drive on the fly you could just take out the hard drive no good what do you mean can't hook up a diff hard drive? "you could boot into someone else system on a different hard drive, but you'd never get into mine" right "so, what happens i fyou forget your pass?" you're fucked http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/filevault/ is there no other way to get this onto your machine except by Airport? i don't know ipod oooo good idea when are you getting here soon k fuck it i'm waiting i believe my connector is at my place shit i can pick it up tho it says 2 hours otherwise yeah who is at the office? sameer and jason good] alright... i'll be there in 30 min or less sweet have any other good tunes? did you give me all your music yesterday? not all of it i was just thinking that i need to delete a lot of this i'm tired of it i need to thorougly cleanse mine as well what to replace it with tho? the stuff i got from Dan was ok but not much that was great I also got a few interesting things from Jeffrey i've already raided Maria i need to go on a massive hunt ha exactly we need fresh meat you know what you need to do what's that bring your laptop to a 100mbps connection and look on morpheus or whatever right what is the ruling on that??? is it ok so long as you just don't share the music you acquire? it's never ok technically you don't even own the songs you buy digitally now you sort of license them i think i'm switching back to radio for a while that's crazy slightly you know what else is crazy? there's no such thing as a standard keyboard layout ? they're all fucking different KCRW is pretty good http://www.wprb.com/ ok enough radio sux man WPRB is treating me pretty well right now i'm referring to the beginner's manual i tried to ignore it i can't it's written at a fourth grade level do something send it to me sent check out the Saving and Opening Files page i was only making a small changes and they lead to big changes and .... "aside from some grammatical errors, what do you see wrong with the opening and saving page" it is written for an idiot You will notice.. i just read the entire page fuck it then let it be stupid "right,, but your problem with it is that it's really elementary" right? no my problem is that it's not written as instructions it's written as a dialogue In order to save this letter you will need to click on the Files button on the upper left hand side of the screen. what would you change that to read? Click on the <<FILES BUTTON IMAGE>> to save your letter. "I would change things like ""Now you will notice that the sentence ""Practicing saving and opening files."" Is on the page? Congratulations you have successfully saved and opened a file." Now you will notice is strictly a spoken reference right i agree for one thing "addressing the audience as ""You"" is pretty bad in and of itself" w.e "The sentence ""Practicing saving and opening files."" now appears on the screen.

"Sameer launched into a ""this should have been done weeks ago"" rather than actually discussing what we should do" my only ideas were to get rid of at least one of the things either the grass or the kit or the chair i've seen teh grass we own a picture that we could use it looks like grass which one? the old people sitting with the picnic basket in the grass fuck it but Jason is dead set on the kite why don't we use that alright well i have nothing further then exactly the kite is too difficult you can't make one from stratch and expect it to look like its flying the direction i was giving was "put something together no matter WHAT it looks like, and we can talk about it then" yes do that asap just slap the bitch together i'm trying its not worth putting lots of time into it we need another idea that's the problem plan b is exactly what i asked for i said if this doesn't work then what and it was make it work and really i don't have any other good ideas that don't involve what we've been doing what do you mean by that? that don't invole what we've been doing i mean the only things i've been thinking about involve grass and kites and chairs ahh http://www.caustik.com/cxbx/index.htm help me with this email... k i am trying to explain why we are *fucked* in terms of the box "1. Kites cannot be made from scratch to look like they are real, much less flying. 2. Royalty FREE images ARE available, but have been ruled out because they: cost WAY too much (>$200), and the reasonably priced ones are either ""too much like MSN"". 3. We have rejected the option of having a ""Plan B""." dude leave it alone seriously why? i mean i appreciate that this is ridiculous but this has been going on for weeks and it's going to cause huge problems ah grrrrrrrrrrrrr honestly the kite we have does not look like a traditional kite i know i pointed it out he doesn't care cool alright slap it together what idiots it would be a good idea if we had the money to do it easily yeah but it's not a good idea trying to do it for nothing just buy the image and it was my idea and i don't think it's a great idea there should have been another idea that could have been executed without all this a picture of a rose or whatever well at least there should have been the willingness to accept it why don't we just go after a picture of a helicopter over a south american moutnain top with a real cougar inthe background draw that i don't think they get it honestly i can't comprehend where they're coming from which is probably why this isn't working very well and i'm sure the situation is mutual because everytime i try to explain it you get told to just do it my explanation basically gets ignored help me write it it's my fault because i'm still trying to do it seriously it's not going to accomplish anything but pissing jason and sameer off they already *know* ok "empty chair in background facing us.. string from chair to kite in foreground, large enough to put SimpleC logo on one wing" is that the idea? ha i knew nothing about SimpleC on the wing i just made it up thought i would throw that into the mix can we hang in office and use fan ? been done sans fan mit fan could be better? no idea really i have a friend who just got a powerbook with 10.3 k how do you set it so the icons pop up when you roll over at the obttom go to the apple menu and turn magnification on in the dock werd this isn't going to work the kite? yes i'm telling you just slap the bitch on there that's the only one that looks even remotely correct as far as position all i can tell you is put it on there and let them see how bad it is here i am!!! what's up buttercup butternuts lol shoot me the manual i need the original copy you sent me ha i have what is it you're asking for? decided to send that email huh? oh yup "we'll call it ""the washing of the hands" "" yeah my email would have had a little more spice but i think yours is better "again, i go for the Rumsfeld" ha yeah i deleted a few sentences the one I wrote was pretty smack to the point this sucks you suck next yeah you guys are idiots you continually fuck the company and thank you well that can be our next email when they ignore this one "... and I would love for someone to explain it to me." that was at the end anyway you could still send it... lemme get back to this inane manual k i'll brb tell me if that is any better much i figure it's something you can at least work with certain things like how i re-use the italics in the keys definition i'm not sure of and leave up to you "well, all of it i leave up to you,,," but i think you know what i mean yup just make the rest of hte text like that and it will be ready to go uh huh i'm working on it now talked to sameer post-email yet? i haven't seen him werd he's drunk from last night guaranteed ahh i guess i may not see him then? i'd say that's a safe assumption this is such a huge pain in the ass i don't think jason's version would have helped many people no? haha this entire manual is idiotic ok give them the fucking QRG anyways i digress that's what i was thinking but maybe it's intended for a different purpose? well he's trying to replace an instructor i see what he's doing but what we should be doing is shooting a video what needs to be done is make a video that is soley screen shots and voice overs errr.... shots of teh computer screen while going through the processes discussion for a later time yeah how hard would that be? "we just need a voice, right?" editing is a long process werd "ok,," page 6 what about it i'm on it ah :-( LOL it looks like the rest will go quicker tho good ".. so i got that going for me"" -Bill Murray, CaddyShack" heh after you save a file SimpleC tells you have saved teh file what is the button on that box? done? can you find out? yes thanks Done thanks np i'm changing the name of the beginner's manual to Natural Disaster HAH LOL www.sfs.upenn.edu erre www.sfs.upenn.edu/seo anything? no http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/search/resultsmain.asp?source=quickSearch&brand=allbrands&selImageType=7&chkRoyaltyFree=on&txtSearch=kite&subSearch=Begin+search&UQR=jrypnm&hdnSync= ?????????/ for the front of the box a bird? this is what i'm leaning towards bird? what bird dude click on your link i see no birds that's hot yeah? are you going to buy it? or make it? buy how much? $250 jeebus they said i could spend up to $500 make sure you don't buy it before you come up with a few options and show them to everyone we'll see there's actually not the much to choose from that pic would look hot if you put the simplec logo on it in another shade of orange that's one of the reasons i like it because our scheme is orange and because of yeah "Learn to use a computer in one afternoon" yeah something like that i'm telling you tho... find a few options before you spend money so there is at least the illusion of a choice choices suck my arsehole i don't care what they do going to maria's i'll catch up with you later haloo whattup diggity dawg nada what's up with you? nothign much what have you got on my list right now?

My Mom told me so. me too huh what a coincidence the color of the test site is really bright that's a good thing right? i guess so what about that background? what about it bsy busy supposed to be and there is no full SimpleC logo with the word SimpleC nope it's fine it's much better than what we had and the quotes are odd with the person's name as a large title the names are stronger than even the section title probably should be that page looks weird altogether in my opinion that's the combination of formatting that came out the most recognizable oh well i like the one we have now better i don't eh the new one is undeniably better in terms of most everything i'm not sure what i'm hung up about neither am i it's much easier to read maybe the background that's actually one of the newest trends in web design not many people have adopted it yet but i like it and old ppl will def like it it looks like fabric is the enter key used within the context of our program? what do you mean yes you have to press enter to load a web page ok after you enter the website address in the Address Box yu p that was the biggest pain in the ass what was the entire manual you saw how it was written right trying to decide whether i want a new cell phone/service is this because the three stooges got new phones? and my plan just ended then yes any suggestions T-Mobile y i've heard only good things how's the beginner's manual coming? i'm on the help page i thought one of the pages should be re-ordered as well k work it out with Jason and let me know i was thinking of switching files and web do you think that makes more sense/ i think it's arbitrary ok nevermind then "what i mean to say is, the pages are pretty random as it is" well "i think it makes sense to have the into, then posture, then the two input devices, sign in, help" "write, web, files, levels" files after write ok proceed i hope you aren't struggling with that thing as i did not much i'm editing it a little bit more just to make it fit alright let me know when i can look at it k i'm on web so pretty soon i hope that's a bitch the keyboard doesn't show the 2nd character keys for reasons of legibility nothing for saving and opening files? there wasn't anything on there orginially and it didn't all fit what's up with the screenshot in changing levels in does not include the top or left bars that's what Jason asked for is that supposed to be the full screen view? does it really matter? "yes.. if it is the full screen view, then the Full buttton should read Norm" the first shot referenced is the full button which is on the norm page okay but the screenshot does not have the left and top bar' which indicates that it is a full page "nor does the write screenshot, for reasons of legibitlity" it'd be nice if we could have a shot of the left bar for saving and opening files k I took one i'll put it in if it works out if it is not possible or doesn't look good at all.. don't worry abou tit k i'm done with it and i'm posting it on the FTP sameer just asked me for it ok i want to play a fun video game Bond i don't think i'm going to like it bullshit 3rd person that is hmmm nah it's great i'm buying that pic doit done great its so nasty out TRUE perfect day for video games i'm wearing gonzo's pants cause i had my white khakis on riding my bike ha that's asking for trouble yeah where are those cd's that i gave you the other day hmmm good question probably still in my bag damint heh lemme check when are you coming to philly next i may have taken them out still in my bag i guess ill be in whenever it stops raining ha see you in a month yeah what's up "nm, reading about Jeffrey's Parking Ticket conspiracy theories" what's up wiht you not much just got back from the philadelphia senior center how did it go? eh well its difficult with some of them they don't respond? they are slow i think we all need to move to Miami werd what are you working on the box werd how is that coming pretty well anything to preview? nooooo no pre-releases weak alright when is the release so i can look forward to that when we can have a good printing whenever its stops f-ing raining so you are done with the box and just have to print to move forward? no i'm making options that i need to print to move forward can you come in tomorrow then? what do you need by tomorrow to move forward on the box when does Jason get back sometime later this week "ok, i was told i had until then" what else are you doing? right now nothing the covers for the beginners manual i just want to get this shit done asap and the brochure those are done both come from the box ahh alright "well, we need all that asap" "so if the box is the first thing to do," lets not wait for jason or anyone else "beyond that stuff,, i need to sit down with you in person and go over the excel stuff that sameer and I came up with, the one you and him talked about planning out hours for" honestly that was ALL sameer ok well then you and I will redo it but it needs to get done my opinion is that anything is going to be a shot in the dark so what he has is fine but we still need to sit down and break it down even further "in terms of the projects, etc" and put our best estimates down k by tomorrow you'll have all the options ready to print??? for the box that is i'll have options probably not all the options how about thursday afternoon could we sit down then and work on all this stuff? yup tentatively plan on that ok is there anything you need at the moment nope we'll have to get bond by thurs afternoon i'll i think you'll like it we'll see have you finished GT3? thirty some percent i have 35 or so cars i actually put it down to watch some tv last night alright... time for a sandwich... brb k I am away from my computer right now. i just bought pedals and a helmet online? yeah the ones you showed me? http://www.crankbrothers.com/products/pedals_s_eggbeater.php "http://www.skirack.com/browse.cfm/4,756.html" what size did you get? medium have you tried Soulseek? ??????? www.slsknet.org try it hmmm can't do it now but i will later on my laptop k basically kazaa? same use better method werd talk to gzo... he says he needs the QRG and Beginner's Manual you get stuff square with gzo yes superb "so once these are done, what are we going to be working on?" once what is done "box, qrg, brochure, website" "once all the printed materials are done.. we will work on projecting for the next year," planning things out lighting up tutos with tasks and deadlines making sure that all printed materials are correct (final revision) then.... the TEA website and re-working the SSI website maybe who knows that's why we have to sit down and plan k what's kicken haus some company is paying $1 per computer hour to relay spam = $168 per week interesting you gonna do it? "no, but i considered it" oh here we go it's only $16.80 a week there you go http://www.spamradio.com/ every time i look up Madonna on Soulseek the thing crashes but just madonna ha its a sign would you believe there hasn't been any Madonna on my playlists for almost a year? i wouldn' t 6 months hahahahaha almost a year hahah w/e been that bad for you huh? yes i lost all my tori amos too time is slowed by a factor of 2 without madonna it's a regular tragedy funny can i preview the box ideas? no why not the images are embargoedc per orders from the Ministry of Culture by pain of DMCA death ??? no free samples uhhh I'm just asking to have a look not until you're of age I am of age i need to see some id i'll show you the next time I see you if you don't watch out "great, that's when i was planning on showing them to you" "or if your lucky,, depending on the method of id" do you have any madonna on your playlists? yes ha and i am willing to share a trade? yes madonna for illicit screenshots? yes "no deal, mine are worth more than yours" give me a break just let me see NO we're still toying with them that's fine we have three so far i just want to have a look at what you're doing probably three it will stay that's cool I think there is possibly some value in letting me see them now and I don't see any drawbacks "if it's monetary, we'll talk" yeah $750? extra? relative "ok einstein, lets see if you can you can divine what they look like" how about a description ? there's a picture "well, i'm assuming they all three have the image you purchased?" in the background and there's some text in fact on two out of three there is all of the text that sameer wanted how about them apples? that doesn't necessarily make me happy but i'm sure he'll be satisfied "actually... he'll just say.. ""that's how it should be" "it should have been done 6 years ago" or some shit but i'll just settle to see how they look and be quite happy with that i'm anxious to see what you have done with that picture because it seemed like it had a lot of potential and that was just from my brain hmmm maybe as a compromise i'll show you something else nah nah nah... come on there's nothing to lose we lose the anticipation probably the best thing of all not at all "it'll be a nice introduction into the ""first drafts review process" here's what you're getting: i'll send you one of the three brochure covers i did think of it as a sort of trailer i really like that picture as do i box fronts please main non i hope that means yes here come the files this girl has amazing taste in music and a fat pipe what more could you ask for this cover for the brochure cannot be produced on our printer how come? "well,,, for distribution anyway" because it uses too much color i suppose that's why there is more than one version although i find it odious odi was a happy dog odi wasn't arbitrarily restrained from genius i didn't say anything about restraint its a great cover to order from a printer another point..... maybe that restraint then provides grounds for even greater genius bullshit IF there were any restraint at all that's the problem we had with the box in the first place which there isn't the box is a huge bitching issue on both sides myself excluded at the moment "well, just so you know, i'm not wrong" in case you were wondering its not about right or wrong its about expectations not being met on either side damn you madonna crashed a fucking again i think i shall have to resort to more urbane climes "on the plus side, my shpongle is coming through" ha "well,, check this out" I had a big heated conversation with scott and sameer the other day about? eh delays in the company in general did you come to a conclusions? and regardless of who points fingers where we all agreed we need to get stuff done quicker i made some points about resources and their availability people and their availability and the mis-direction on and on and on in the end organization is the only solution as always "but," this time I was told that I have ultimate authority in terms of telling jason and sameer and scott to step off when i need to or when they begin to hinder productivity dun dun dun don't let it go to your head i was actually instructed to do so right i could care less it is just a difference in how i react to them slowing our company down which is the proper perspective vs my previous.... well they are just slowing their company down which was my fault at any rate I'd like to have more review (preview) processes built into most company projects "while, I don't necessarily need to see anything right now... I don't see how it would upset the process any.... and I actually believe it could only help..." what do you think? "i was in the middle of typing, ""as long as they don't include the box" :) your an ass you know that don't you YES . good that's the only way to be why is the box such a touchy issue? no touchy "well, non-compliant issue" mostly because it's fun and because i want to print them out because i can't tell what they look like on screen i understand that... and i'm not going to stop you from printing anything so printing is the real preview "well, i'm less critical of screen vs print" and really to keep the creative process holy so you can finish the ideas before you get feedback on them? yes what if I vow not to give feedback non whatsoever you're going to hate this answer but that's not possible because whether or not you say anything you still think it and thereby influence the process you're that easily influenced? karma is a bitch ha "no, dan, i'm just a sensitive kind of guy" alright we are going to work on setting review deadlines so there isn't this misunderstanding k my review deadline for the box was when Jason gets back right so from my point of view i'm sticking to the deadline right k i'm not usually late if we are going to be an inflexible beaurocratic bitch of a company with many things ok... that was my last shot ha and i'm spent pretty much i just like to acclerate things "because, unless you haven't noticed.... we still aren't making any money" TRUE but not my issue it is everyone's issue i disagree you own part of the company as well it's marketing's issue there you go i do what i do the best i can do it box needed given what i have and the circumstances dealt "and on this particular thing, i'm not giving in" because beleive me.. .i've preached that a lot the box is going nowhere until the fools return from San Francisco and the conclusion was drawn as "Do something about it, it is your job, take it as your responsiblity and make changes" so it is entirely on my shoulders now the box? or everything in general? "well, let's agree on after they get back i guess, since that was said before this was established" "managing in general, yes" not vision or direction you're in charge? yes if i need resources i have to make them happen "if something i'm a part of doesn't get done, it is my fault" because i didn't make the necessary events occur at some point in the near future "i hope we quit changing how things get done, because I have trouble keeping up" i agree i think this was a failure on my part just as much as anyone... because prior to now i have been giving excuses as answers for delays "like... well, this person wasn't available, or whatever" what you've described to me still isn't a functional heirarchy what is and why not the roles of the managers are not defined in such a way that information is centralized how so? "on a purely operational level, who's telling who to do what in which case isn't at all clear" "as it relates to me, there isn't any defined person that i can work with to make decisions" and it works soooo much better if there is only one person "i meet with 3, i get vision and direction, i execute, meaning I tell whomever I need to whatever i need to get done" you get decisions from me whether or not it has to be finally reviewed by others that isn't what Jason and I discussed the decision will come from me "i have enough experience doing this that i know that my job only works when i've got a direct line to whoever is making the final, FINAL decision" because otherwise we run around in circles doing stupid shit so if there's a vision i need to hear it directly because that's what i work with i don't disagree necessarily and... that point will be brought up i've brought it up with Jason and to my knowledge he understands this right so i don't know where Sameer and Scott fit into it the only solution is for you or me to talk with them about it "if you're talking about you managing me and Gonzo, because that's all there is right now, then i think it's silly because it's really you managing Gonzo, which is silly" its coordination in a larger organization this might make sense alright "well," the company is completely failing to meet deadlines everyone included that is the problem and nobody takes responsibility they point fingers you say that its jason and other fault for insisting on kite they say its you being a bottleneck I point out everything that i can think of that causes the problem i am absolutely not responsible for the delivery date of this box when it was such an emergency to have we didn't have the money to print it and the date slipped and then Beryl was going to print it and the date slipped and now it's this conference so PLEASE take that back because i GET my shit done on TIME i don't arrange my priorities THEY do I didn't say anything to the contrary i said nearly the exact same thing well he can take that bottleneck shit and shove it up his ass the entire company needs to be more efficient the way the company works because it isn't "this is entirely an organizational management issue, of which i have no one to manage, so the efficiencies are not going to be seen by harassing my work" i'm not harassing anything i'm saying you're not going to get the art any faster than you ask for it right "and if we continue to throw projects into the mix at the last moment, then it will take even longer" that's also organizational management right I agree that's why it makes sense to have a person planning all this shit and then managing it as well "i hate to tell you this burciago, but you can't manage by proxy with those three" you shouldn't be directly responsible for their bad decisions they should right..... esp when they're directly responsible for their good decisions in any event TRUE but if they are focused on doing their individual tasks and need someone to coordinate then that should be possible as long as it is planned and communicated so you're the COO? ha LOL "unless jason wants to be,,, which i don't think he does a good job of doing specific parts of that job" but that's what i'm saying either your it or you're not not only when Jason doesn't want to be i completely agree so we still have a problem i think that if they want me to take that specific responsiblity of managing.. they need to give me the authority that goes along with it "otherwise, it doesn't work" "and personally, i have no ego driven attachment to the position" in my mind it 's no good if it's unofficial and really if he wants to be available everyday to ask you if you need resources and to coordinate what you are doing with others... then fine but i haven't seen him fully functional in that respect with the company as a whole "he's good for snap ""DO IT"" decisions" which some of the time contradict each other or other things in teh company "and in my opinion, hinder progression" even though it is sometimes perceived as moving the particular project forward EX.... making the QRG as short as possible.... it was an IDIOTIC waste of time ha but what would it be like if you hadn't ? it would be 80 pages instead of 50 no it would have been 50 the majority of hte time spent was not the text TRUE which is the only functional difference between onur's and yours not true as a result of jason and my time spent ok *qualifier we spent many many hours trying to scrunch which was STUPID i had already reviewed the text and revised from that point it should have gone to you that's the process "not,,, lets see if you and i can sit here and fuck with it to see if we can get it down to 5 pages" thereby making it utterly useless these sorts of inefficiencies are all over someone has to be appointed i don't care who it is fine but right now the box waits that person still doesn't exist right i agree "they have tried to put me in that position, but without the necessary authority" is how i feel i think you're a fool if you accept it that way "don't worry,,, it isn't a done deal yet" we have to wait until they get back yes so what else is new "in the meantime,,, can i preview the box?" Ha yes nice! Adding another level of management without the ability to give a final decision only creates further inefficiencies in a company of this size. ha i think that says it all three layers of management for 10 people is insane yeah i think they don't agree based on the fact that each of the three are busy enough with other things that they don't have sufficient time to manage do you think that is safe? either sameer or jason should be managing sameer isn't capable Jason needs someone else to do what he's doing and only be a manager someone to take over business development maybe in 20 years his ego would be secure enough to let someone else be in charge where he otherwise would but not while his parent's cash is on the line which is ultimately screwing things up you know what i learned with a Management Concentration at Wharton? ? let someone else do it ;) delegate "nah, it's more like, manage from the rear" like the President isn't really in charge right "unfortunately, they're trying to make you President" the only way i would run for president is if i could finance my entire campaign on my own "that doesn't make sense in light of as the president ""let someone else do it" which is exactly what they are trying to do do you know what gonzo is doing with the website? i think i may change that one page in light of what you said it isn't going anywhere until there is time for a comprehensive review... that's my understanding... which... could mean nothing k i'm taking it off my list what is on your list? ha good question yeah should be just the box right? pretty much i mean there are tons of things to do list them TEA website and materials our website but you've already drafted that simplec or smilingscreens? i was speaking of simplec k what about SSI i'm happier with it than pretty much anything else i've done ok the text needs to be changed and it could probably be recoded right but that isn't you not me wasn't me man heh what else nothing ha if you finish the box... then we can work on something ahh but you need to print tomorrow you are looking for things to do now? yup hahahhahahh what? "sameer, do i have ultimate decision on the website?" ? "well, yeah,, i mean, for the first draft/version" LOL exactly what we just spoke about anyway want to work on the website? which? simplec what needs to be done? i'm not crazy about the index page hmmm i like it the paramaters are simply make the four options prominently displayed in a way that will spur people to try them "the only thing is, those four links at the moment could be interpreted to be just statements" i am absolutely not turning them into buttons ok.. why? "until we move the site to flash, buttons are bad design" what is bad about them.... refresh me for one thing most reasonable designers don't use them anymore when text serves the same purpose at a smaller filesize an image won't improve the amount they stand out on the page because it's still text laid on top of something useless we have no pictures that correctly identify the ideas right that was my hangup that tutorials didn't have appropriate images features we could use the 6 buttons email the email button but tutorials and have a look nothing the only way to make those stand out is to seperate them with descriptions one line each? w/e just so long as there is black text in between images right won't really improve the distictiveness "and not having ""simplec"" with the logo" no fix? no need? fine the way it is putting a logo large enough to have the SimpleC with it eats up too much real estate to be useful yeah agreed and the entire site preaches simplec and the logo should be strong enough to stand on its own that's why its a logo right contact page ? there are too many option in my opinion not my deal well give me your opinion i think it's fine at least we coudl consolidate ask a question and send us feedback TRUE its roughly the same thing either way Tell a Friend to help others learn how to use computers. haha "hey, friend, help others learn how to use computers" weird Tell a friend about SimpleC better Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn Send us Feedback about SimpleC fine although you may want to differentiate it a little bit right i think i should go buy a playstation Send SimpleC to a friend err no i think we should just change the trial page request form description to have simplec mailed to you or a friend FIne what do you think? usually Contact is to contact the company not to refer right? right i maintain that the about us page is awkard looking it could be better i'm thinking of ditching the italics and making the quotes smaller yeqh maybe bringing them in line something let me know if you put a change up k http://neocyde.net/simplec/about.html looks better take the end quote off the first quote riiight "seems a little weird with the people quotes having their names larger than the quote,," but i understand uniformity problem is there are three types of quotes on the page right i also think that we need text for all publication quotes not just links or text as in the case of milestones and curious parents do you agree? sure now what "Trial SimpleC Request Form Have SimpleC mailed to you or a friend!" "remove ""Tell a friend...."" form Contact page" k what's shakin nothing i'm playing with? The Crimson King unfamiliar it's a drawing ahh you at office? it stopped raining my ass is going outside where are you? the office werd did you print out the box options? yes and? i still like the one i like but it needs tweeking where are you going outside?

but now that you mention it Nada scott mee gonzo SimpleC and its parent company Smiling Screens does that even make sense ? no SimpleC is a product exactly i also am thinking we might should switch the organizations quotes with the individuals k what do you think there is so much spacing too.... i think if we're going to put all of that shit on the same page then it needs the spacing i don't really care what order its in we should also list contact information on the contact page what is the correct way to handle the product-company relationship what are you asking me in terms of the media title on about us and contact information on the contact page Find out about the makers of SimpleC or w/e i don't feel good about the website what about it "which, could mean nothing to you or anyone else" I see the functionaly improvements but looks wise something isn't righ t "functionality is your department, looks is mine" "and not that i care about what anyone else thinks (even though, WE should care as a company),,, nobody i've shown it to prefers the new one over the old" i do if you will buy 10000 copies that's fine is how i see it it looks much better is how i see it "otherwise, we are at the mercy of people who would potentially buy the product" you you you you does that justify it? yes otherwise get someone else to do it it's really that simple that doesn't seem like a wise approach that's business ok i don't understand why you are unwilling to work on things to benefit the company LOL please its mikee's way or the highway no matter what anyone else says "if mikee likes it, its done" yup that's what i'm here for to make those decisions if you don't like the decisions i make i understand then there are other people who can make them this isn't an ego thing well it is i know it is but i'm confident in the decisions that i make at least partly "as you should be, i guess...." i just want the site to be attractive to as many people as possible there's a certain level of arbitrariness when it comes to attraction right i understand that attraction is based more on relationships that surface appearance even if the person has no relationshiop to simplec "this site, in particular, has much better relationships" oh i see what you are saying between the Elements on the Page right if you want to change the function that's your deal i know i know but i KNOW this looks better end of story ok what you up to?

we need somebody who can write real copy ? like pages and pages of text to fill up space stuff that isn't repetitive dunno what you're talking about ahhh can't youjust copy from internet? hells no why is it that we at most have a paragraph on what our stuff does? nah there's more "three out of five pages on our website have less than 100 words, and one of two remaining is an order form" there's nothing to work with yeah the about us is the longest page really really lean sit e i agree "well, i assume you are proceeding with the slut-site" yeah but no tell me what pages are going to be and where you need more text i will find or produce "what's already there plus a ""partners"" page" lemme send you a file what's on that page ok do you have illustrator? no nm shop did that work? did the file come through? yeah k just the heading? the menu see the pink bar at the bottom with the white text on it? you cut the old farts out? yes no these are the pages inside of the site i have no pink bar with white text "enjoy our 10 day trial..." i have menu oh yes that is in the middle my friend meh yeah yeah eat it that's the intro to each page roughly the same as the bold text we have now on the about page there would be three sections each with this type of heading that's the way i see breaking it up but we have zero text for most of the other pages much less we have no text that pictures would look nice with tell me how much text you want for each page word and paragraph count the copy should end up looking roughly like this: http://www.apple.com/macosx/ paragraphs of description with accompanying screenshots or whatever and a sidebar of other semi-related stuff would be fabulous extra fabuloso i guess the sidebar can wait until we have something else to talk about but i'm sending this conversation to Jason because we need more shit before i do more with the site tell me what you want on what pages/ i don't care what it is as long as it's long decently written and something HA the contact page should be full of shit about the company the trial page should be full of shit about how to try it and how other people have tried it and whatever the about page should have pictures of the people we work with really that's the partners page now but the partners page is supposed to be people we link to who link back to us or some shit reight]\ ok i'm being called to lunch brb cool laters do you need or would you like business cards? sure how many would you go through in the next 6 months 20 ok we can print those here then yup morning and to you what's up i'm beat already.. dear lord! i went for a ride at 6:50 got back to my place at 8 and passed out this morning this was? yeah good day for it? awesome yeah i woke up at 7:15 and did yoga nice what are you up to today? yoga is supposed to be tough dunno i have a meeting at 2pm scheduled in for the always tentative friday 5pm ha i'll be downtown all day we've got to check out Bond julian is supposed to hear from lockheed by today yeah oh yeah? oh shit.. the one on one combat is shit TRUE ahead of its time ? are you kidding? it's horrible no LOL they haven't figured out how to render it yet no way to sight the other person you think the one room idea is better than split window? i don't think it plays better but i think it could be done well i see the point doing my regular friday night thing with Maria i think will be here for rest of day werd ok "well, maybe later this afternoon we go check out bond" sounds good what are you up to in terms of work? good question you still don't have spanish i assume i did an ad for Jason last night no but he never told me if it was going to work pretty much fooling around with the brochure for a minute i guess putting the white top on it and the qrg the website's going nowhere pretty much the only other thing to do is the mouse cursors "yeah, until i come up with some direction and text for the TEA website" but still need more text for simplec i'll work on that this weekend if it is still needed it definitely is i talked to him about it but no committal and? alright he just agreed or something LOL "well, if he doesn't bring it up.... don't bring it up" i'll do it for you k well "for ""us" right its the for FREE part that gets me as well it should whattup doggy nm chief i think i'm on damage control with julian tonight on yeah? yeah what's the story? well "if it weren't damage control, it would be celebration" HA i don't have any details is he already celebrating? but i deduce that he wasn't hired wtf don't ask me mang what did you hear? mik called me lookin for him cause he text messaged her something to the effect that he was upset ahh shiza i'll wait for the full story don't make much sense to me werd miki is all worried about him you've tried to call him i guess yeah only contact today has been with miki two text messages the latter one saying that he just wanted to be alone do you think it's a bad idea to respect that? but she's worried about him being alone when he's so depressed or whtever probably not such a bad idea so long as he isn't doing himself any harm he's going to be really hard on himself do you think it's possible that he would?? i thikn i'm going to leave in a bit and see if i can find him eh i don't think he'd do anything silly ok if that's the case then he should come to you when he's ready TRUE but he's sorta like me in the respect that we don't fall on our friends when we need them the most "you can provide him with the opportunity to put it into context, but ultimately he's has to come to terms with it himself, however he chooses to" oh yeah sure but if i don't put my shoulder out there... put it there by all means werd you at the office? yes what's kicken there dealing with RIDICULOUS SHITE such as? Cartoons drunk hungover sameer? ahhh marketing <sigh> fucking cartoons dude i couldn't even stand there cartoons for what/ i had to walk out of the room to keep from laughing in their face an ad for Beryl ummm an Advertisement why cartoons "so there's no ""race" give me a fucking break LOL word for word wow well pick one is it that fucking hard does every company do this? no it's time consuming and you didn't tell them all this? i told you i was laughing so hard that i had to walk out of the room hahah how did they respond? don't know i haven't been able to pull it together enough to go back "well,, just think it out and go tell them" exactly how and why you feel or \ write it down i'm not dealing with it again until he asks me i got the spanish translations that's just mindboggling spanish? for a spanish version of the program i know what is mind boggling? cartoon s yeah as ads not like so stupid how many of them have you seen a illustration like a cartoon that look good wait like a frame by frame? YES wow that is weak it's sameer's way of trying to micromanage what i do he drew them just ask him for the desired message and a deadline for your first drafts i already gave them that yesterday i don't think he even looked at it lemme see do you have it? yes send it that's pretty strong gets it across i thought so the point is it is so difficult to get cartoons to look good Jason was going to show it to Beryl who was going to change it ANYWAY so it was just to have *something* "they think that you are being stubborn just cause.... if you give them reason , you can work with them on it" i'll talk to jason about it later ok when sameer isn't here good yeah do that nobody likes dealing with sameer "he doesn't help, he takes over" and dictates exactly there's no discussion he has horrible biz relationships with everyone he makes it difficult to be rational its sad i am so much happier when working with jason and scott you and gonzo anyone but sameer he needs to learn to just put his points out ther and not try and choke you with everything let people do their shit ok.... . DONE LOL I am away from my computer right now. alright man out? i think i'm headed home k i'll call you and gzo when i know what i'm doin perfect "the ""e"" in your screenname is now lowercase" whattup with that dunno i didn't change anything oh well what's up nada working have all this email and crap to respond to in light of my mass emailing on friday mass emailing?

none oh well rinsed completely rinsed it's supposed to rain all damned day i just closed the windows "no, you're going to be an ugly lady" probably be fat and work as a cashier nobody's going to want to marry you "see, parents aren't allowed to tell you these things" messedup intro what's it from? anti house spiralling ah "i think i like the second one better than the third, but i've only listened to each once" i think i agree so what's new with you? not much turns out the list of words for the spanish version i got is only about half complete werd i bet they are all way too long Leo made abbreviations the list we gave him wasn't the whole list that sux getting my ass whipped in chess by whom zorn_star online like in two minutes ha or less http://www.abilityhub.com/mouse/mousekey.htm errr not that http://www.hearthstoneassisted.com/ what about it check out the fabric on the left yeah? just sayin one of the first times i've seen it i'm tired of designing for old people jason and i talked about the ad today he wants me to find new pictures so he can take it to Beryl and let him change the pictures ha new pictures of what? iceburgs or something ehh ok what does iceberg have to do with us it's cold aight maybe i'm too tired to get it and then again maybe not "i guess we're going for a ""we are the world"" thing now" ahh wind sun icd ice alright man... i'm too fucking tired for this shit i'll talk to you tomorrow later the office what is she doing? rolling around on the floor oh god new iTunes werd? yup i have a question 4.5 that i know i asked before what if i have a set of music on my ipod that isn't on my itunes will that set be overwritten when i sync? theoretically when something syncs it picks the newest date of whatever happened so if you add files they should show up in iTunes yeah but i don't know what the real policy is as far as DRM is concerned only thing you can do is try it "and if its gone, i'll just get it from you again" better yet back the fucker up and try it space issue but i'll figure it out "when i print out letters using the letterhead, there are little dots about half way into the page" and i also had a question about the taper on the right hand side of the black stripe.. it tapers in as you move towards the top has it always been like that? i believe so then it's probably supposed to do that i dunno about the dots aight do you see the smile? oh yeah two smiles? one in white at the top of the black stripe and the one that goes inhto the text the second one is not where the dots are? yes the dots extend as far as the second smile might be the quality at which you are printing it also might be the quality of the graphic inlaid into the template show it to me the next time we see each other alright when are you here next? should i try it at better quality i'm at standard now fri try it see if it changes aight werd it works on hi res k now we need some decent stationary TRUE sameer isn't even using the template i know do you think stationary is important worth the money will make a difference? most people print at least their first pages on good paper http://www.snafu.com/Rotation.html i have a question lemme know when you have a min ? ok background info.... printing a report in MS Access which has a sample copy of that same form printed on the back that sample was previously derived from a BMP file basically a screenshot of the form k do you think it would be best to continue use of bmp or use a jpg or gif are you constrained by file size? no i don't think so anyway doesn't make a difference then IMIO usually they are large batches of the same form they are timesheets that get printed for all summmer weeks it might print faster if you switched to gif is bmp better quality? eh i don't think bitmap compresses the image alright thanks np iPod Agent i think is the software i might use right row order normal or interlaced for gif normal kruder and dorfmeister never dissapoint have you heard about Today Show and NY Times? ? we're def going to be in the Times and might be on today show good "at this point, the only thing i really want to hear is that they've sold 10,000 copies" werd all this press is good for what? that lets hope do you know when this is going to happen? ny times called yesterday or so so prob take a couple weeks and I just helped jason with the email to the today show last night "if it actually does, i would like to have the new site up before it happens" makes sense what is the status of the site? waiting on content ahhh yes how long after you get the content? the layout is done as far as i know alright i'm putting in the last tour graphics right now then a review to see if they want to make it longer and then? ok i work with idiots at penn its amusing what is the idiocy du jour? these time sheets they were printing out tons yesterday nobody proofread shit then i went back to find that there were all kinds of errors... much less the missing sample shot my boss asked ME why it wasn't caught "and i gave the general ""because nobody proofread it" "i'm not responsible for the programs, just for making the behind the scenes shit work" there is a person who's entire job is to manage this off-campus work-study program hilarious and she was completely oblivious to the entire thing not even realizing it's her job to review all these documents lucky for her it's a university job yep i need some sort of game that looks like work when its on the screen sounds like you want to make games for a living no no... play games i'd be content if i could access my laptop remotely i'd sit here and organize my music call gonzo and tell him to wake it up whattup? isn't your laptop in the office? ahhh i see i have to clear XP home and put XP Pro slightly larger proposition right such a pain in the ass i wish i has a30gb hd so i could just image mine over to it http://www.neocyde.net/simplec/web-content/tour.html apple biter looks good will the menu rollover? at some point Tour is not a menu option whattup with that index ? yup i'm a genius http://www.neocyde.net/simplec/web-content/ don't ever tell me the truth about that one i like the image flow on the tour top left to bottom right i thought you might i'm a simple being simplicity is tough to achieve i've become fairly adept at splicing high levels of condascending undercurrent into my reply emails are you asking to get fired? not at all i'm having fun at work mikey this is a penn job what fired? please tedi got fired from his for no reason or excuse me reduces ahah TRUE but this is harmless "Hi Peter or Dan, I am having problems with the site and need Instruction to log in a s a new coordinator and to make anew job description.

"instead of ""Some Other Random Shit" jason and i made something yeah? AH Learn about SImpleC Success yes k what you and i will do is take whatever we have from me and jason print it out and review it later k but you can work with what is ther now right the tour thing doesn't fit anyway however i do like how you changed pronounced Simple See to the Simple Computer a lot werd Maria's going to be in the burbs until around 7 ahh so we are left to our own devices muahahahaha she does want to cook tho i think aight i think i'm goign to get something to eat then k cause we won't eat til 8 if we wait prolly good idea may do that myself what time you ready to leave at? whenever do you have a need to come here? not really k call me when you get home alright i need someone to carve out the back of my head feel up to the job? sure great when can we start? are you in philly we can start now why are we carving out the back of your head? i just came through philly on the way back from dickinson but didn't stop tedi brought me home what are you up to? nada you? working at penn about to leave in a bit putting myself back together and uploading the box for jason and probably doing the other pages of the site and linking up the menu etc yeah good deal how was the rest of your weekend epic i had a really great time did they end up going out after dinner? um yeah rox and the girls did jason and scott might have everyone else went home how far did you get into Bond? haven't i think i may have lost all my progress somehow not that i mind right i am close to having consolidated my music its such a pain ha moving it all around and such i just have to download from the ipod now how much is there? and find the duplicates i don't know cause i haven't merged the two yet i finally figured out the process tho yeah? its such a fucking pain by design? yea apple fucked it all up to protect the copyrights? i don't know probably its stupid tho or it's just poorly designed? its just the entire problem of not being able to truly sync i wonder how many people try to do what you're doing who knows i mean its just a ppain in the ass once you have files on your ipod that you don't have in itunes and you don't know which ones don't match right if I just knew which artists or whatever that i got from you it would be tons easier in this case i had to export all my songs from the itunes folder to another folder "putting all the files in one folder, not separated by artist" then i will download alll the ipod songs into another single folder then i will past them from the one folder to the other allowing overwrite THEN i will have one collectin good lord do you have enough space for all that? yeah barely http://www.apple.com/isync/ yeah that does shit "i guess it makes that whole process easier if you have a Mac, but i've never tried to use it" the point is that they don't let you go the other way no matter what "i think this might, because it's date-based" maybe not though they might just be talking about the calendar yeah the calendar and contacts and stuff all that works great the way its supposed to just the music they screw with definitely by design i deleted some of the stuff i knew i already have on my laptop to make it faster when i pull everytying down from the ipod i had already started to immport from ipod into the same folder as i ahd put all the itunes music in but the dumbass software would make _1.mp3 extensions on the names instead of prompting for delete which was infuriating heh what software are you using? iPod Agent this is supposed to help you? it allows you to pull all of you mp3's off your ipod whereas apple only lets you push up to the ipod from itunes k sucka mr t? is that you? just finished the website text with gypsy who in the hell is gypsy JPZ gypsy i SEE said the blind man i suppose that's convenient as i'm just finishing up what i was doing with the website yeard can i see negro tonk i'll post it let me know yoink where are u posting? neocyde.net ok i had a few suggestions about the site such as? just that the links be white text instead of blue or black http://neocyde.net/simplec/web-content/ when rollover you mean in the menu? yeah white won't stand out here. lemme send you the file for text let me know if you have any qs k switch the mission statement at the end for urs and put yours on the smilingscreens site eh? gonzo will have to do that werd everything good? so far aight... "jason asks how you feel about the ""pie incident" which incident was this? "and has been suggesting that you bring an ""extra"" pie for the next occasion" "you know, you an maria taking the last pie of the evening" dude half of the other fucking pie was there when we left ummm... you wouldn't have believed the panic which occured when the second pie went missing it was torture "you see two pies come in the door, you expect no pies to leave" painful tell jason it showed up at a fashion show where intensely hot girls consumed it lasciviously "why wasn't I invited?" "alright, i'm off to the girls place..... when are you coming to philly next" likely tomorrow alright.. see you then in the afternoon "yup, i'm going to try to go see Kill Bill with Tedi if you're interested" 1 or 2 2 i've yet to see 1 alright maybe i'll try and see 1 before but we'lll talk k night we need to get the website up before end of wednesday laters what's the deal are you in phillly yup nice how did that text turn out? well i'm going to finish the last few pages today we may need a little more for the reviews page alright shouldn't be a problem jason and I have become quite the cheese machine "yeah, press it out cheez whiz" i just scored us a lot of furniture too oh yeah? from where? fucking great dude from my offce here at penn it's nice shit? like 5 swivell rolly chairs two nice tables a really nice office set CHAIRS! all kinds of chairs yay for chairs fur real how we gonna get? have to get a truck later this month good deal i just went over to see Maria yeah FREE frizee paid for by the endowments of overfunded children fur real check it "otherwise,,, the people who manage this building were going to CHARGE to dispose of it" "file cabinets, credenza, nice desk, tables, chairs rolly and not, etc etc" ha from grad towers? yeah why are they getting rid of it? caus we are moving out oh yeah? to where?

Listening and gathering knowledge, SimpleC makes the computer easier than ever. Read how our program has helped others." which page does that go on? Partners ehhh nevermind we were wasted right Scrap it k that's more of an about us page might be useful there but that means we still don't have a partners page right that should go on the reviews page but the second sentence is awkward and it probably needs more text "By Working with many orgs and inds, smiling screens is able to offer complete software, hardware, educational and advertising solutions.

"In the ""Practiced an Online" Tutorial > ? anything but greek really i can't find it send me a link to the page so i can se http://neocyde.net/simplec/web-content/tour.html shit ok "Quit struggling with small buttons.

Click on ""Web"" and use the Internet, instantly." more web grrrrrrrrr ok did you have anything in mind points? "Jason says ""half buttons half web with buttons so great and look web so great" that's almost word for word my issue is that if it's more about the buttons than the web then i should change the graphic which is not a big deal "Explore the Internet without fear.

instead of tutorials they can actually use? still tutorials works the same way oh loads differently i see what you mean yeah just have it as an option tho cause not everyone will have flash they will if they're using simplec that's the only problem right so... but those people don't come to our site yeah they do but i don't care if they do isn't that where they're directed when they open up the browser? i want the people who have not yet paid money for simplec the real reason i'm bringing it up is because it makes the menu a LOT easier to deal with i know the only way we could spin that is if we listed all the programs that are included in simplec adobe flash ie "and put it in such a way that lets them know if they download or buy simplec, they have no problems loading any file, including flash" "there would be issues with using those names tho.. adobe, macromedia, microsoft" nah they all have loose policieis what about icons they have specific icons for the programs? yes are you in contact with jason this morning ? no do you think there woudl be legal issues putting those icons on our website? do you think it would call attention to an area of our program that we don't want attention? brb when was the last time you stepped through the User site? ummm last night which part tho? the categories jason and i went through the internet part last night k the categories I don't believe I have ever looked at don't i'm changing them ok i have some changes for the internet part k as does jason i got an email from jason but that's what i'm doing today so .. you want me to send you my changes later? asap ok as soon as I get to the office how are we going to make sure this all gets posted by tomorrow? 2.5 hrs umm well what don't you have done? the pages for simplec.com are don e right the pages for the user site are not if i get the user site done i want all of it posted before the article runs aye aye CAPTAIN only because i'm probably going to work my ass off to get them done how are you doing it? flash? no or just regular html and it will line up ? dunno yet is there a particular reason we don't list amazon in our shopping section? not that i know of $10 says there's some insane reason inane right we need to reconfigure the buy page k that's gonzo's deal reconfigure how https://www.simplec.com/clientorder/ to make it fit in the new site design i told him to put the menu at the top and i guess reapply the stylesheet i think we are going to link to the forms tutorial as weel well and also use the buy page as the example in the forms tutorial if that makes sense "um, sort of" as long as they don't actually order when they use it there but then again ahahah it doesn't make a lot of sense the idea is that if you don't know how to fill out a form we'll show you how eh "i mean, if you don't know how to use a form" not the exact order form you aren't going to be ordering that's confusing anyway AN order form is ok alright it can stay as it is we'll just link to the tutorial from the order page "should the ""Call 1-866....."" be at teh bottom of the order page?" yes and gonzo has what he needs to make these changes? no not yet also "if you are in the site, say on the partners page, or contact page, etc... there is no title or indication of what page you are on" there should be i've put titles in the files all the contact us forms need to have the right font all gonzo stuff right? yes we should have a canadian pharmacy in the health section do it http://www.canadadrugs.com/index.php?REF=googleGeneralWords/keyword=canadapharmacy looks good right? yes does www.smilingscreens.com load slow as dillzzz for you too? always great it's teh way the page is coded damnit alright the entire site is one page it all loads in the front right because frames are against the rules or something who makes changes to that site? gzo? text changes yeah i really don't want him fucking with the layout not at all just text changes changing my position sameer had some changes too and take peck off and solt and onur unless you think that's mean or something ?? what' smean taking htem off? yeah fuck that werd lol ? we are ALL penn people good stuff good lord i had forgotten i hadn't noticed losing peck and solt makes us all penn "losing" ha peck was lost to begin with IMO i like the smiling screens website so do i it hasn't needed any work since it got posted i agre e i don't think it will for some time let's hope http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/05/05/helicopter.crash.ap/index.html boring they walked away! yeah even more boring "all right chief, we'll see how boring it is the next time you step in a news helicopter" i've been in a helicopter its the shit but reading about a lil crash is not i bet you didn't crash land and the WALK AWAY look at that fuckin thing it's a mess i saw the video it was a pretty harmless landing broke its fall on a 4 story and landed on a two story i'm sure that shit hurt HAHAhahahaaaaaaa but falling from two stories isn't that big of a deal lucky bastards relatively speaking yeah curious as to why it crashed cnn says it clipped a building that was after it was already out of control from what i saw "not too long after i rode in a helicopter above the grand canyon, a chopper crashed, killing 7 or so" in the grand canyon gonzo won't have the forms with the menus by tonight it was a act of congress just to get him to apply a six line style sheet uhhh ok what was the problem with the style sheet the stylesheet for the site defines the colors of the links and the text size/line height i have a mix you're going to love aight how large? 80Mb we'll save that for in person k alrightr i have a question what's that is the rest of the site going to be up by tomorrow morning? gonzo is giving me a ration of shit over absolutely nothing nevermind... talk to gonzo he's being stupid on purpose and it's pissing me the fuck off treat him as stupid as he acts i find that works well where are you at? office why are you busy? nah what you need one sentence descriptions of the six tutorials on the user site do you know the user site is supposed to fit inside SImpleC\? i was just told the exact opposite of that by who jason no no no he just asked me if you knew that it is supposed to fit inside simplec NOT 800X600 "the user site that we are using in the program size for 800x600" unquote The user site that we are using in the program. Size for 800X600. is that how it supposed to read ? that's how i read it he must have had a brain lapse well guess what it should fit in SimpleC what am i guessing it wouldn't be a guess if i told you you quit good guess but no give me a break yeah can we just get all this shit done for today it's going to be 800x600 isn't that just more work for later? it's less work for now as long as the new site is up and fully functional tomorrow I don't really care right we can change the size of the tutorials tomorrow or whenever soon "for right now, it would be best if we could have it fit in SimpleC... if that is not possible, then do what you have to" where the fuck is Jason outside he'll be right back what's the problem "onzalohbriceno@hotmail.com says: (5:28:38 PM) I cannot appreciate the stylesheet with the forms because there is almost no content. Send me a screenshot via email of what one of these forms will look like." his phone is here i know what the forms should look like menu bar on top form call us at bottom done au contraire we're not even talking about the menu we're talking about the fucking FONT what's the deal with the font didn't you give it to him? i'm sending you these conversations you can figure it out we're going to call you on the conference phone check your email first "all he's saying, as i understand it from him" is that there is no content yet now that completely different from what i understand it to be ok situation is you gave him details on how to define text and etc he does not have content so is waiting for content and i'm supposed to be the one that has it? how about this "my understanding is that he doesn't understand what these pages are supposed to ""look like"" and he wants me to do this shit for him" just do the entire site however you want it done and send the files and we will post as is no recoding "I DON""T HAVE THOSE FUCKING PAGES" right "gonzo coded those pages, if i make those pages they aren't going to use his PHP scripts" he has the formes and all i'm asking him to do is apply the style of the other pages to the forms ok that's done and this has been a two hour waste of TIME its done as soon as you send the rest of the page it is done do your 800X600 for the user site jason is here do you want to speak with him? can i call you? im is fucking all this up call cell?\ home? 8568456586 yall were missing each other something fierce i'm not entirely convinced that we were. i think somehow you were oh well lemme know if you need anything else i'm working on the sentences thanks where are the sentances going? on the right hand side of the entire tutorial window? of the menu structure like a directory/ right ok i've just realized it's going to have to use frames wait maybe not somehow i worked my way around it on the smiling screens website i'm wondering if i'm going to have enough time to do the lessons themselves ready for the sentences? email them i'll be ready for them in about a half hour k sent tx np will you ask Jason about the amazon thing? yeah no reason i'm replacing uBid with Amazon ok i trust you what did you pick out for the canada drugs? i found it cool sorry was in other room np http://neocyde.net/user/ money shopping and health sub menu's go off the page scrolling is a necessary feature at least for the HTML version werd and if you click to tutorials from simplec it will automatically take you to the tutorials submenu? in an ideal world that we don't happen to live in it will probably take you to a seperate page for tomorrow it will take you to a separate page? probably so ok works for me "sameer can yell through six choruses of the Doughnut Song, half of Amber Waves, and right on through Remind Me" how goes it just woke up... you> eh not much are you coming to city?

Thanks, George (Jiantong) Yu Senior IT Support Specialist The Wharton School University of Pennsylvania 3733 Spruce Street, Vance Hall 210 Philadelphia, PA 19104 (215) 746-4712" that's a fucking IT Support Specialist who can't read and can't figure out a very very basic interface how appropriate "Senior IT Support Specialist" maybe you should be Senior? "Like ""Grand Master IT Analyst" eh i don't want to bite off that much i do like the idea just to put you relative to the other geeks yeah man... i don't need it "if I need to boast,,, i'll do it in conversation" or on my resume IT Anal is enough IT Asshole i wish i could just come out and put that on there some places might let you maria's havin it rough with tedi and shit hav eyou talked to her about it? i didn't know that something was amiss eh she's bored this i know but she also has men lining up to get with her to which i suggested that she not pursue because it will only add confusion ha TRUE she est conforked but if she's going to be with Tedi then get fucking married already cuz this well together-but-not thing i told her to make a damn decision right don't make no sense exactly good unified front lynard skynard "isn't as good as led zepplin, IMHO" agreed "however, i hear them differently" different concepts operating probably fleetwood mac does it for me everyonce in a while yeah not often tho just nice to have around little to emotional or something "STop draggin my, stop dragging my, stop draggin my heart around." sing it i wish i had stock photos to play with did peck hit you up today? no i think he knows better by now at least i hope he does he said hi to me i ignored i'm not going to use photo rollovers right now it would be nice but going to take too long to find the right images eyah i see what you were talking about when you said you wish you had stock i just sent an email to the unholy trinity about it the only thing that pisses me off anymore is sameer yo i'll let you in on a little secret of mine "if you only talk to him like once a month, it's not that bad" yeah that's been my tactic i don't even care to see him outside of work at this point much less at work i usually enjoy him socially but i can not stand the yelling yeah seriously the entire whining attitude i have enjoyed his company socially before... but anymore I cannot keep the work experiences out of my mind he wouldn't exist in my world if he weren't paying for it LOL ouch well... we've covered taht one "yeah, i expect that at some point he'll have the balls to say something to me, and that will be it" the rest of my options vest in two weeks less than werd i'm wondering if we're going to renegotiate renegotiate what? your pay? the contract in general i think project basis is best i don't specifically because "i often i'm waiting on things i don't control to get a project finished, and would therefore be waiting on things i can't control to get paid" if they want to change it to a project basis i might as well work for someone who will pay the rate that most people get for projects like these on a schedule that's reasonable yep so you think it would be better to look for other work? that is entirely up to you "yeah, but you have more information than i do" not really if you are asking me about your job security i'd give you the opinion that you needn't worry good because although you can't tell i really like the way things are the bullshit isn't really more than anywhere else and the work is ideal and the flexibility is ideal the only thing that i see happening more often than i think is digestable is your stubbornness with certain issues HAha Daniel Frank and I talked about this that's about as frank as it gets a lot actually many times you have good reasons and when explained... i think you sway more than you think oh sure other times your just stubborn as shit not as stubborn as you think because really that's just a front right so i can decide but and i know it is but others don't it's sort of built in you know? instinctual and they are put off by it more will probably change as i get too old to argue much or care right you should care a bit less about what you do for SSI in my opinion yeah we're getting there not like lower quality work just not feeling that the website or brochure or whatever... is static and on display in the M. Edgcumbe gallery... open for critique by the worlds artists ha other half of that is it's what i'm going to use to try to get into art school so in a sense it really is right but you could also submit other versions "this is the version I was told to make by the jackass employer..... THIS is what I thought it should be" i still keep the concepts nothing gets developed as much as the actual product though right but when it comes to making a rollover or not HAHaha right? yeah you get the point definitely that's the kind of stuff that i'm just fronting on because it doesn't speed anything up because really it doesn't make huge difference although from a certain perspective i wouldn't argue the point as much if i didn't think i was right add them all up and look at it from jason's perspective jason needs to leave my job to me like he did originally if he wants a rollover most of the things he wants is arbitrary and even if it's small its up to him most of the time at the end of the day i've already thought about it and made a decision and turning it into a big thing right by discussing it over and over again my advice tell him that you've thought of it really isn't going to change how i argue the point and why you don't want it give him the opportunity to see it from your perspective the argument is really to guage how important it is to him that's not efficient not really but better to put your explanation out there i do he does respect it i have we still argue hey and if you put it out there and he still wants it i'm not the only stubborn person no? takes two to tango different positions you were just asking me about job security yeah but my attitude is that i'm paid to make certain types of decisions and that if they don't agree then others can make them be certain in that yup i am because they see it as.... you are paid to do what you do.... and you are an employee of the company haha that's pretty funny because and if they want something pink and purple then they should be able to get it that's not the way the contract is written i understand your point i'm a consultant i get both sides i don't get benefits i told Frank that "if they wanted to make me an employee with all that goes with that, and could afford a real salary, then i would be much more agreeable to showing up at the office every day and being less of an ass hole in general, but at this point, i'm getting out of it exactly what i want because that's the only thing that makes the compensation worth doing this." i can't live in the city so i work from home i'm doing the art so i can apply to grad school esp since the stock options were written the way they are they're not even being reasonable about that so my opinion is they aren't going to take them back or anything like that "they're not valuing my full attention, so they're not getting it" if that was true valuing how? then why write them they way they have "they"" didn't write them" i'd suggest you talk to scott about it really it doesn't concern me that much because i agree with you i talked to him about this and he has gone though them again that it's not going to happen that way but it's not the language that counts it's the tone they set the tone i'd say that if all you want is a springboard into grad school.. fine i'd say if you are interested in working for SSI in the event things start to work out to the point that we are compensated correctly then you are not laying good groundwork for that "the only thing i'm ever interested in is making sure that what i'm doing at the current moment satisfies my happiness... in my philosophy, everything else works itself out" that's good so i completely respect it i'm satisfied i think i have a good understanding of the situation and perspectives and have for a while its been a while since i was involved in a conversation on this topic with sameer involved and i told him that he is getting a fucking earth shattering deal he seemed to value being able to control what when how etc to which i told him fine go get another graphics designer... "and hell, i'll even help you find one" but you will be sorry i deeply appreciate you speaking to him on my behalf and it is a stupid move he should be speaking to me too it is in my best interest "because every time i ask him, he says everything is find" fine and i DO ask him i make a point of it maybe he's changed his mind i let him have it the last time this shit came up if he's to fucking arrogant and stubborn to see that i'm right fuck it haha not much you can do either way he wanted project basis i advised against that he's just a lil boy with a control problem a whiney brat i don't think about him i don't deal with him "we should give him the benefit that he's got major amounts of pressure on him... like more that i would choose to deal with.. but, you're right that he really doesn't know how to maturely deal with it" i don't recognize him as a working part of anything i do with the company ha exactly i work with jason scott you he's very far removed gonzo that's it sameer and roxana can go make columbos Haha adam does his own shit yo and i see no reason to disrupt that mans work i've seen adam maybe once right i've seen an article in the ny times once HA good job Adam that's all i have to know yeah he worth having around just for his contacts even if he did nothing he's i want a projector ebay or swipe one from Penn haha you know what i'm talking about ? a television projector yup so i can watch movies at home 10 foot screen which wall though brb dude i'll find a wall i have two very nice walls in my room yeah man ps2 on a projector gran turismo life size shiiiiit haha http://www.lightwerks.com/projector/projector_detail.asp?id=463 Yo that's not cheap you can get up to 17 foot screen LOL burciago that is the shit you'd have to watch it on the building next to you no to get a 16.4 foot screen 16.7 you have to be 20 feet away well .. the projector from the wall and what room do we know of that's 20X20 with 10 foot cielings only 10 feet away for a 8.3 foot screen diagonal the screen measurement is diagonal i know this it's also on a stand and i could do it in my apartment put the projector in the cabinets the screen would be 11 feet high and have it go about 10 feet diagonal so the height would be what? 11 feet we are talking 16:9 ratio good god i have no idea wait the height would be less than the diagonal numbnutz if i had a 10 foot diagonal 6 ffeet for the big one see what i mean jean? all right i'm there i'll play now where to get i have to do a lot of research but i really don't know why people don't do this instead of sets um back in the day you couldn't use them for certain things like video games i think its cause people like to watch tv with lights on too and that too which i do not i have new parameters for future living spaces oh? yes must be able to use projector at max diag loft yo i saw some siiick lofts down in the gayborhood prob expensive maria said they were cheap too ask her about the one we walked past how cheap? as cheap as what she pays now maybe 700 damn well glad that i've found my next toy i was feeling empty without anything to research and lust after haha http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=2478850823&category=49990 Yo that's cheap wtf dunno i'm gonna watch that shit tho HAHA anywhere under 3000 its mine no shit can you imagine?

"sort of, but i keep getting told that we aren't using old people in our ads" so not really right i think it is time that we start moving away from old people i disagree really? yes why so because that's what our market is right now why our market should be anyone with no previous computer experience because this program isn't going to sell to a mainstream demographic we are excluding lots of people it's a smaller subset than that there are tons of people who are not 65 or older who would use the software maybe minorities nah dude i'm telling you but anyone who's white and middle class is going to learn windows incorrect most people don't use the majority of features found in microsoft products most users aren't going to settle for learning something different than what's used at work/school "my mom... occupational therapist,,, yes.. .uses windows for work,,," the vast majority i.e. Macintosh wants to use something simpler same with step mom i'll believe it when i see market research same with most parents i talked to this weekend and PENN graduation when i present it as a product for senior citizens its always "hell, i want to use it" in that case we don't have materials for anything but old people marketing materials i don't think it hurts us to expand to anyone with no previous computer experience that is what our text says but that isn't my decision as for the order form should be simple easy to complete short and sweet IMO i was trying to make it look more like an ad for the final push? yes i see your direction not sure i'm of much help are you at home or at office? home going to run an errand alright bbs what's up making lists for you and gonzo at the moment k have you heard anything about changing the SMSC logo? no scott just asked me to come up with options to replace it ok i like it the way it is ok so i'm sort of confused as to why this came up out of nowhere ask scott i have no idea Learn about SimpleC Success the orange around that is lighter than the others ? do you have the description for filling out forms? the short one i gave you for the lessons i'll check thanks orange is supposed to be lighter alright i accept curious as to why to differentiate the columns are all of them different shades? yes i only notice the last one as being different fyi i think it'd be cool if i could see the difference in all three depends on the monitor you're using no computer will be the same yeah well my laptop my dell lcd my viewsonic crt none of them do I see more than just the difference in the third column they get progressively less pink from left to right "i belive you, i just can't see it" i can't find that list maybe in the mock-ups? i can't find it either and it isn't correctly listed on the website what isn't? the rollover description for filling out forms i just found the description nevermind "have you completed the ""Download"" buttons?" does gonzo have a copy of golive? ahhh that's the crux? yes ok gonzo ordered yesterday have you confirmed that? because as far as i know he didn't ok will confirm whats up changing the menu werd did jason send you the list yet? http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/040519/234/726q1.html no what a nutjob i think it's fake i hope so or else i'll strangle him personally ha would be great though perfect joke problem is nobody under 25 knows who he is right hell i didn't know until jim carrey pretty much "well, in addition to the list jason is sending" i would like your help with a banner ad k eh it will be in the list is this the one that has to be under 4K? 50kb k the user site that the program points to is broken ahhh wonderful ?

"You are really wise to tell me this now" cause if it slipped out of someone else's mouth I would have just waited until we were all out and about and Craven hahahHA was there and I would have seriously seriously injured him so you know this assmaster? dude she knew better "and would have been still hitting him, and the cops that would be pulling me off" "Well, to be honest with you guys," this all levels the field a bit right? but her's was far more methodical than i drama queens yo if this wes thing is about anything who admitedly got with an older british rock queen it's about drama I think so yes "But seriously though," I was REALLY not in the mood for that kind of drama yesterday haha karma's a bitch I HADN'T SLEPT SINCE FUCKING THURSDAY and i got on the wrong train yesterday from Baltimore that's when your head opens up wide enough to let these things in oh SHIT! "and the bitches at work were, well, bitches" "Mikey, I think that yes it is a bit Karmic" comedic but she used language that pissedd me off on purpose? such as? because this fucker was in her head and not just the vag "head in the clouds" lol which used to mean aww.... maria is a girl yes still it pissed me off to hear it subject to the illogical irrational emotional rollercoaster definitely LOL I guess this is what i get in some ways "why the fuck do they call it a roller-""coaster" I did call for this time apart cause that shit ain't coastin last time i checked ha seriously seriously its more like a VW bug hitting a Mack truck on crowded San Fran streets dude yeah you just have to step back "yes, sire?" and let it happen Let the Wes thing happen? did she tell you the whole story though i mean you know Wes has another girl The boy has the girl coming in Texas who may or may not yhes trying to save the poor sap in that vw is only going to hit you with shrapnel come "Well, i guess" i mean not necessarily meaning you should step aside form the situation The thing is that as her friend i advised her not to go with it all "i'm just sayin,, in your mind" because it doesnt look good in the future right i did the same But i can see why she likes the attention probably why she's all about it... in retrospect "Yeah, safe" if it was just the attention whatever at least a portion but it's not yeah It's not just the attention? nope It is deeper than? drama yup they need drama if things coast... they throw the roller in there She said that though "Mikey, tell me" cause i know she was protecting a bit "her mixed signals are: ""this kid needs to open his mind up but i'm not going to put in the effort to watch him do it" I see TR again a project RIGHT that's fucking exactly it That is EXACTLY what i said but she denied it and i told her yup you will get caught up in this thing she's denying it to herself and lemme tell you EXACTLY and you know what i really dont want to bail you out this isn't something she's going to stick with for the years that it will take they are so ignorant to themselves ha So in the end nothing really changes It's TR all over again not much "Fuck man, that is too heavy" all girls need their dose of drama the abuse isn't going to be as bad for Marty McFly but still mental abuse "Well," yes especially with this girl and all you see I think yeah she likes the torture of it it puts pressure on her its a challenge to act with her heart But she said that if i said stop she would lol] the funny thing is that I called all this to happen ha i think she would stop Tedi But whenever I got REAL close to some broad but i also think you don't want her to under those circumstances I would push it all away last second she needs to take responsibility "Yeah, but Mikey you know where she goes with all of this?" "Me, motherfucker!" HA I get the brunt of this yeah like she gets the brunt of my shit but that's why i'm saying don't tell her to stop I mean can't i just skin him or something cuz then you get all of it every bit dude But if i cut the head now youcan't be mad at him No i cant really HAHAHAAAAAAAA i said that you're anger is with her last night or whatever emotion I can't blame him or be mad No really the anger is with me This is really all my doing And I understand that that's true in the absract And am taking the responsibility for it That is why i told her that i dont want to jump back into it all again because she needs to do somehting like this good move in the chess sorta way but a lot of it is based on faith that in the end faith is for pussies My king will still be standing tedi yes? that's something i put faith in "thanks, tone-loc" seriously "yes, i am cynical" Well i am confident of that but you know how it is you feel a bit belittled but this person by i meant by this person you never met What really made me mad was that the sex was in the room i used to live in and still sleep in "yeah, i didn't like it when i heard that she told you that you HAD to accept her going to see TR" because you didn't I know that I am tall as Oak with a bullhorn bitches thing is though tedi The truth is that she and i were friends before it all if you really are going to be apart ... fill in the blank i told her there's no fence to straddle here agreed that was my main point at well "? So i should just split?" that is yalls advice? a break means nothing if there is a net right that's all i'm sayin you two have been codependent and now if you're going to not be then its all mangled Yes this is true "if break, break" "if not, resolve" right Hmmmmm none of this.. see you in a week shit either way is fine ha of course i'm all about black and white "Well, emotionally, neither is" right And our whole relationship is very very gray right complex so either you two decide that you are going to work together to fix that and resolve all this shit or..... you decide that the solution is to take a real break Split yep Hmmmmm that way you each can free your minds for a bit "yeah, its a bit stressful now" instead of muddling around in the swamp of ambituity Cause that is a lot yeah i hear that well the ambiguity worked when they needed to work its a temp fix but i never brought up shit to the page that only delays "You see, i dont really feel like shit is broke" "and actually, we were getting along quite well" TRUE much better than the winter but now i see that that might have been steming from some guilt from Craven HA um he's a pretty recent development i think it was better before then yes not to say it isn't contributing factor Well you see this whole thing is really making me step back and value a lot of things that i took for granted And it really makes me sad mayhaps the purpose of such an experience because things were going so well for a while here "yeah, i said that" to her yesterday but you NEEDED it to happen btoh I know "Yes, this is true" The timing is really really interesting though HEH if this happened in January i would have said fuck it "then you get into the... well, do i want it so badly now that i've seen that i could lose it and it is now a challenge again" yeah keeps it fresh "man, i need a fucking drink" ha werd and a smoke mmmm and beef oh christ and vegetables and a martini and a bullhorn LOl "Yeah, that's what it really all boils down to" This being something of a becon to see what ive not seen a minute and all that i have taken for granted "yo, tedi, her affection is because she sees the same things" DAMN THESE CROSSROADS DAMN YOU TO HELL Same things? she says to me all the time why she loves you it's a spontaneous observation HA thats sweet things she doesn't express when you're around so much mostly because she focused on being the witness and the adjuticator at once " i know i love tedi, i know he loves me, we know we want to be together eventually" I can see it already "But people change in ways, mikey" and the big LET GO always in flux and you have to let go can cause for greater change no matter when you choose to do it cosmic inevitibility "I know i know all that shit, nostro" so I am just saying right now what do you WANT I am seeing things and feeling things that i havent in a while k so go process it "Honestly, all this discussion is pushing me closer to being back together" ha than letting go fine figure out why you feel that way "Well, I think i know" there's a queue forming "Honestly, when one takes things for granted that are really important in one's life" and focuses on what they THINK is really important then one needs a jolt to remember the value of their original desire "desire isn't enough tedi, you also need to be able to learn something new" How so? I am going to marinate on all of this k You see the thing is guys I really dont want to be in a relationship with anyone else do you really want to be in a relationship? good one mikey Talking now - yes because it's in jeapordy? or because you want it but i dont think she does um eh i don't think you need to worry about what she wants when you think about this what the fuck do those grunts mean? LOL girls always want to be in relationships yeah Hmmmm This fucking phone keeps ringing here and i am not answering it lol i hate this fucking job i have two jobs to balance my hate amongst i know i am leaving to teach big highschool football players in a matter of minutes how to read and write haha mmmmm highschool foootball playyeeerrrs "Mikey, they all look like Fat Albert" "no yums for you, trust me" i want beef you didn't know that's mikey's thing? faaaaaat albert beefy OH CHRIST i need someone to carry my kitty i don't think i want to get that on e nor i k seirously though i'm going to lunch And I am going to get a smoke aight laters before i leave for the Junkyard Gang "k, i'll catch you cats on the flipside" THanks Guys haha laters np anytime peace can you make a taws version bcard for adam leon as well? yup probably later this week tho ok burciago yes i'm not even in a relationship lol and you're stressed out about it? um only to the point of not wanting to be the avenue of communication yeah its so funny pathetic i mean i refreshed my computer its so much better now like a new computer "refreshed""?" jason requests your presence on msn messenger yeah reformatted the bitch oh good idea its so much better actually... everyone in the office is saying that about the new user site menu good deal "yeah, i can tell you killed your brain on that one" ha i don't have flash yet ha that won't play on flash player jason and I are looking at the new tutorials menu can you insert the explanations for each? would you like me to send you and email to that effect? yes sent you an email with additional descriptions you here already?

"well, thankfully i have a brain" mmhm so i only had to change the address in like 5 places because the pages share 50 pages or more where the address appears ha good thinking i'm lazy and i've learned to plan for my laziness ha "yeah, that's kind of why i made it a big deal for g-zo to have golive too" cuz i'm that kind of lazy i got my sonica today i think i need a preamp it's just *not* loud enough sounds greaet but i must be deaf why you deaf? what do you need a pre amp for? i want the signal out of my powerbook to be louder not what a preamp does what does a preamp do? circuit board basically switch board rather ah so i need an amp the amp is what you need there you go i've got the damned thing turned all the way up and it's not ear shattering and i want ear shattering the speakers should be powered house shaking hmmm give me the link to them bitches http://www.klipsch.com/product/product.aspx?cid=712 def not 116 dB yeah you only got 60 watts per channel still though.. my issue is that jeffrey has the same speakers and his are fucking LOUD hmmm did you turn you pwrbook volume all the way uup? doesn't make sense nor to me either your pwrbook is loud on its own "with the internal speaker sure, but i'm not so sure the line out puts out a strong signal" can you hurt your ears with headphones plugged into your pwrbook? barely ahhh that is the problem then how to fix? that's fucking weak ummmm yell at apple ha but seriously there's no way to amplify the signal? there is but it woudl be better to find a solution w/in the the laptop because amplifying a weak signal inevitably distorts teh sound ah i'm pretty sure they're not going to help me out with that i've got all the levels in all of the places turned all the way up in fact i bet your iPod is louder yeah I don't notice the lack of treble but then again I'm using an Audigy 2 24-bit sound card to do the audio processing and not Apple's BS on-board headphone plug. (I've always been pissed off at Apple for having such crappy audio) ha you're not the only one i think they finally switched to digital audio in the G5s at least the port is but as far as i know OS X doesn't natively support Surround sound yet right "Optical digital audio in, optical digital audio out, analog audio in, analog audio out, front headphone minijack and speaker" yep i think its your lovely crapple you should call them and see what they recommend if anything "what, besides the order form, has our pricing on it?" website some of the marketing material you need to see if they make an external sound card for your apple that's sort of what i bought the sonica http://www.m-audio.com/index.php?do=products.focus&ID=eee876ef2e6cbb4ac377f83c406e8885 i want more chikn hahha you're hooked yall still goin on the party boat tomorrow? me tedi maria kate what you doin?

penn o something about the weather has changed since i fell asleep dark? rain i was on the hammock and now this must move quickly k better i'm in the middle of uploading the simplec site to the testsite folder good let me know when i can have a look k ok i think most of it is up link me http://www.simplec.com:81 the three rollovers have a different background than the menu rollovers they also have a different foreground ahh so true there are varying spaces between the partners listed that's an issue doesn't show up that way inside of golive you see what i meant tho right? ok yes is there some sort of standard space from the end of the page body that we can put the call simplec bar? contact/about/download no all are different unless you want to measure it out yourself nah just seems silly to have such discrepancies the links to outside organizations still open in the same browser window should i put his all in and email for you and gzo? no i changed those http://www.simplec.com:81/partners.html do those open in new windows? no they should k http://www.simplec.com:81/trial-form.html the submit button is on top of the call bar it used to be in front of the call bar do you see what i mean? the button is covering the call bar that's not what i see i moved it down another 50 pixels anyway perfect i like the spacing between AARP and PSC that's the way they all should be refresh your browser bang bang sweet now less space between end of guyana and call bar try again bang bang http://www.carametis.co.uk/Image/Troika/Cdc33a.jpg i would bend the shit out of that unless it's made from stainless steel yeah TRUE time to go antiquin say what you know with who i dunno just need to get a bcard holder ah "alright, i'm outta here" k later when you in town next/ friday werd ok... take it easy you too what's the good word some kid i met on friday called me yesterday that makes you feel good i just want to play with his piercings what's up with you eh not much http://www.geekdiy.com/phpn/ how's the flash comin how do i clear the cache so the links turn back orange i dunno i figured it out http://www.uncommongoods.com/item/item.jhtml?catId=3&itemId=10642&nextItemIndex=8&style=&pageId=133&templateId=1&famName=his+accessories&subCatId=38 meh lol sorry what very 1993 damnit what about a tape case that's what i carry cigarettes in http://www.designstore.com/simpercarhol.html that one is pretty good "http://antiques.goantiques.com/detail,tortoise-shell-calling,363002.html" I am away from my computer right now. http://www.rubylane.com/ni/shops/antiquesuncommontreasure/iteml/204sscig#pic1 http://www.rubylane.com/shops/antiquesuncommontreasure/item/103-RL139 gross gold? nasty what's gold? the trim on one of them they are too large i want more of a slim design the thicker slim design tho haha what? there are cases that hold like 6 cards there are cases that hold 15 i want one that can hold 15 so i can put 3 credit cards in with 6 or so bcards maybe red leather yeah alligator is quite expensive you could try skinning one on your own.. http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/addtionalImage.asp?pageID=2120 http://www.levenger.com/PAGETEMPLATES/PRODUCT/addtionalImage.asp?pageID=2122 eh not my type.. but the first one works ok actually strike that http://www.whatshebuys.com/lod-111nx.html what color is it? red or black i give up ha oh for fuck's sake George Tenet resigned that's good i want a hamburger me too i think this flash presentation would work better as a straight video from screen what do you mean most of the animation is just doing what you would do in the program anyway at least it could be and the rest could be done in video and the version of the program that we're selling right now has some pretty serious graphics issues that apparently didn't make the final cut ok you mean that there is part that could be done in video and the rest in flash? eh not really and put the video in the greater flash presentation i'm saying the whole thing as video what was the original reason for flash sameer ? not person reason i don't see a difference he said he wanted something like something that they showed me which was flash actually i don't remember before that when we started talking about it so i don't know but stepping through the email thing and changing the levels and switching between programs and using the help are all things that would look better in video than in flash pointing out the different elements would work in either are you really considering changing it now? distribution wise flash is probably easier although i'd say complete what you have to for tomorrow most ppl don't have flash 6 or 7 what happens tomorrow? and then worry about the rest later the presentation is due? ha that's pretty funny was that not what you were told? no idea when do you think it is supposed to be done? really last i remember jason told me on monday of last week that he wanted it on wednesday of that week so ok that translates to me as whenever it really gets done that fucking sucks i don't get how that means whenever seems to me that would mean asap right what's the difference whenever is leisurely asap is not deadline of wednesday last week would imply that it is already overdue by a week my grandmother just fell over in the yard go help her i did is she ok? yeah lol go help her i DID as if you needed me to tell you i was just laughing at myself anyway.... i really don't understand why it is so difficult for you and jason to work with deadlines it's pretty pathetic really jason's recent deadlines weren't set in rational states of mind right two to tango its up to you to tell him that and set one with him taht is reasonable i did i called him immediately after i got the email when did you tell him it would be done then and talked to him about it and? i don't remember exactly i'm not sure anything specific was set weak not weak quite weak followed on simple.com which got done yesterday there is no reason not to set deadlines for this shit lol double negative anyway... it didn't seem imperative expect more weak ass arguments as a result when we discussed it regardless everything should be clear otherwise it seems that all parties involved enjoy the craptacular situation that they perpetuate eh i'm over it really then jason finds out that it's not going to be done tomorrow when he wants it and he yells and you wonder why no situation has changed alright i don't wonder it doesn't bother me enough to speculate "regardless, everyone suffers" suffering is a state of mind induced only within the ego but... let's all act like sameer and i'm sure everything will work out nobody yells like sameer except sameer doesn't seem to be an real desire to make a success out of this on anyones part it's always someone else's fault or i don't care or i didn't think this will a video be larger or smaller file size than flash hmmm more or less quality larger more quality in terms of still image quality or just that it flows better or whatever "smaller image, better continuity" less processor intentensive the overall screen size of the presentation? how will that be affected by half half the size? roughly maybe 640X480 that doesn't seem like a good idea the screenshots themselves are 640X480 anyway in the flash presentation "ok, size of simplec on the viewers screen" how is that affected none? possibly determining factor is end file size eh i'd do it in flahs flash video is too long to be small that is my suggestion file size right flash player is available for free correct? yup no problem there then also third possibility shoot it video inside of flash flash seven ships with its own codec do we have? i have not many other people have need flash 7 to play? yes which is not free ? is free sorta sux that nearly anyone would have to download tho yes i wouldn't want to give a flash presentation to someone I was trying to convince of simplec being easy... all with the requirement that they download the latest flash that's logical it seems that a regular flash presentation is the best way to go k i think these issues can be brought up and addressed before the next version of this presentation is assigned/developed for now just need *something* to facilitate the demonstration of simplec without having the person buy/download/actually use the program whattup nm "ytou?" eh same at the office? y kewl till when? leaving in about 45 minutes for campus are you returning to office after that yup ok i'll probably have lunch around here then go dntn k who is in the office? me that's it? yup great <shrug> get to work you drunk getting 3473933000 have you talked with gzo recently?

just make sure it's rigid these things dent yeah TRUE i guess if i'm really travelling with it i could use the protection and space that's maybe the one thing i'm bewildered by def the protection i was looking for a metal case for a minute i hate the dent on my lid going to have to take it to a fucking car repair shop to have it fixed today i'm working on your ad and i don't know what else i called you last night about the flash thing what time i went to bed early 8:30 maybe that's od d did jason forward you anything regarding that? no oh and i know why i just checked my voicemail he had no computer access last night do you want me to forward you what i wrote up and we can discuss sure what u think i'm writing comments while i step through the flash werd i have a couple responses k "the help section is what moves, not the whole screenshot" yeah that was not the biggest point it is the entire screenshot the top bar drops and rises along with the help button as well as the yellow bar at the bottom WE ok i see it it's in the third frame #NAME? :-D "w/e, that's like 1 pixel" i know you watch this 30 times and see if you see it oh i did but i know what you're saying that's why i'm here to be the annoying asshole that catches everything wait that didn't come out right now what is my gmail going to be MEdgcumbe hells no wire wired 6 characters medcum voxels haha success what the hell is that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel wonderful voxels@gmail.com great any comments about what i sent back to yhou a lot of it might not be worth the trouble of doing is all i think you're splitting hairs but most of it i'll probably do the last one is a pain in the ass i'm not doing any of it today which last one? what else are you doing today? your email ad the one about the mask over the changing levels yeah i agree with you on that how many of the email ad proposals are you going to make ha one 3 two and a half ok asshole :) "i don't usually get multiple ideas for things. i get one and the go with it until it doesn't work anymore, and then i might get another one" well i thought about it in terms of the text that I made and what i would say if someone told me to make 3 proposals of that "which, i would not be so willing to do" so i understand that "the difference, however, is that once i submit the first proposals" i am completely open to revisions/ modifications/ suggestions I am very happy to work like that with you give me one i'll give you feedback "i think the multiple solutions thing is the best way for an analytical problem, but in something like EQ, the efficient way is to work with your best idea" analytical solutions have comparable results whereas emotional ones are almost completely arbitrary and measure only by the end effect don't be so emotional i'm dropping my hotmail account you pay me to be emotional effective design standards the definition of art is evoking emotion excellent get to it later ha i'm pooping squeeeeeeeeeze what is it that you want to try to show in this email sell the best selling spam you ever seen that's what i want to see here's my issue what do we have to sell any decent email program filters out images from unsolicited mail dude ? we are giving it to beryl the images are to be online somewhere that's all i know most ppl aren't going to see the images wonderful i don't care screenshots are no good too small this is all part of working with beryl to see if his shit works right i assumed so maybe a button or something yeah sounds good email button seems to be the button of choice i dunno i like the trays better than the buttons what do you feel evokes the proper buying emotion whatever that buying emotion is exploit the bejeeebus out of it as white as humanely possible caucasion? no white the non-color do it show me white makes sense to me it's SIMPLE "although,, them ther idiots be lovin them some colour" other possiblity is to take the web application and put it inside of it inside of what put the text inside of the web window like you're looking at a web page through our web app the web app isn't so bad you all don't consider my tendency towards the minimal to be sexy enough TRUE "although if you really thought about it, you go more for the minimal than anything else, i.e. a 12 inch powerbook" yes that is me not the assholes i'm selling this to "um, i think the response to simplicity is general" i'm not designing or writing or anything for myself or my tastes and not limited to intelligent people "sure, but they need a reason to buy" as far as the art is concerned that reason only extends as far as having a design that's cohesive.. the reason you're looking for comes in the text right i just want art to match the text to look good so i can slut it out with words i'm not sure there needs to be a lot of art great whatever aligns with the text give me something to slut out i can't sell white i need my big box of art what can i do about this nothing need a headline such as simplec eats your asshole real good Experience the power of SimpleC oi vey SimpleC is computer simplicity "Make life easy, sign up for SimpleC" Power your computer with SimpleC "Life should be easy, power your computer with SimpleC" great take it i have tons i stayed up til 430 the other morning drawing shit writing shit all shit the coffee bonanza? nah alcohol wait smoke i forget i was bored tho dingdingding and didn't feel like sleeping for some reason i could sleep last night for shit i went digging for ambien ? old perscription i used to have in school i want to make an ad/flash/banner with the simplec logo and the power button on a computer k and the power your computer saying shi "the logo with ""SimpleC"" dropping into the power button somehow, then the power button glowing" some shit what do you tink sounds good or the other way around right play on imags play on words maybe a finger touching the power button computing with a touch of simple brb there was all kinds of crappy flow the other night ok i'd leave the finger out of it animating hands is like the most difficult thing ever i'd say faces are even easier time for lunch werd i think the text needs a different format more slutty button different text first so i know where to put it two or so paragraphs with by lines link at the bottom disclaimer tagged on at the very end in very small text right that was the intent you can't do any text formatting? just threw it in there to see what the blocks looked like what i'm looking for is bigger blocks of text? y it isn't possible for you to come up with what you want in terms of graphics? do you want me to tell you what to use? no no what to the second ok then show me what you are going to use and what the number of characters or words requirement is ok and i will write for that because I assume you have a layout in mind using whatever buttons or trays you want etc vaguely i think it should have some ties to the program graphics you know what email is not the button to use in an advertisement being sent by email lol that's a good point why do u say because it's advertising a service that people have already become accustomed to right "so, i'm thinking" web is not good either memo? well maybe email IS good we can say it happens with the touch of a button a touch of simplec lol i dunno its something to think about tho i'm looking through to see if there's anything else i like help yeah i thought about that does the new graphic have the word below the ico n ? yes that might piss some people off why show them the new help button in the email and when they get the product it is different that rules out a lot of buttons eh i' m not worried about that issue files ? i don't like many of these they're from a year ago i'm going to use files what the hell am i going to say about files large clear buttons werd ok do that for now you are still checking your smilingscreens email correct? it forwards to neocyde.net what's the problem with the order page? the bottom banner goes up and down behind the text and images etc etc as it has for the past fucking 2 months sigh jeeezus i've tried fixing it i've fixed it and i've stood over gonzo while he fixed it however he is doing that page is why it's like that at any rate most of this shit is pathetic that it takes this fucking long it isn't hard to do things right in an timely fashion ok ..........breathing.................. there are definitely descriptiions on the internet turoials maybe i didn't refresh lol now there are i also have the reviews page baneer at least 50 pixels below the end of the press seciton nevermind i went to the buy page first that kicks me out of test site right i'm the idiot ok going to ssi talk to you shortly you should have asked gzo about gmail i just got mine free buahahhahahh i got mine first that's what matters by any means necessary riiiight what if i had chosen my username to be dburciago then you would be gay wait..... you are gay damnit there is no power denying the logic "a bit sophomoric, i know" i don't think there should be that much text and I think there should be more graphics? you can cut the last paragraph if you like and make the box smaller there needs to be a buy it now button at the bottom ok or try it today what d oyou think try it err i don't know if that's possible y i think we are supposed to track the sales taht this email generates i dunno w/e have to ask gonzo when he gets back "but yeah,,, a button at the bottom" this is inevitably going to link to SImpleC.com two buttons? i dunno what i think about that could be too confusing? not as good for yielding sales right too many options right i agree can make the top banner into a passive link yeah... i like mine better than that its a lot more basic it's also a lot more clean the color in pdf never comes out as vivid as it is in illustrator i don't have illustrator that's annoying assholio i know assholio that's why i'm sending you pdfs god dan those are terrible yeah yours is much more appealing i must say "however,,, it lacks the BAM!!!!!!!!" if you know what i mean all right emril like the annoying red sticker buy me sticker lol good one that's what the bright green is for i don't have the png shizzle eh not here hold on open it with IE what's the dif between that and the one before didn't the color chage? yeah werd mine puts those others to shame what what hahha what about putting the advert solicit text in the grey box below th ebuy link "i thought about that, but i don't like the idea of it dangling off the end" i might make it lighter why not because it looks like it was forgotten about that's also where the copyright goes i do want to forget about the advert solict part you will for all i care we can put it below the grey it's in 8 point type in yellow font is that latin? greek files button higher? no why? more program grahpics? nah one is enough i'm happy with it come up with some text and then i'll reconsider it ok focker danburciago@gmail.com BITCH! does gonzo have one? gonzalobriceno@gmail.com BITCH! i like mine better and here's why great another mikee-ism shoot it nobody is ever going to register michaeledgcumbe@gmail.com so the option is always open i like mine and here's why people will always remember where to email me and i never have to explore my options "i, too, would have had the option of danburciago@gmail.com" i'm the one and only you are far from the one and only although you do show up in google i know who in the hell is the CAST clearinghouse? check it out what do you mean i am far from teh one and only haha you must have a thing for old people by the way i think i want my name removed from the smsc site i liked it better when i didn't come up something wrong with that page anyway the font size is too big "gonzo might as well just post signs that say ""i wuz here" i have no idea what you are talking about it looks fine here nope dude if you want it changed submit a replacement and he'll put it up free of charge free of tinkering the whole thing is due for a tuneup i don't like the way the layers are activated i more important things to worry about hve before i knew what the css was this cast thing isn't on our site is it? i just rated it what do you mean on our site linked no in the press section its not really press what is it i submitted that review so its just like a forum it's posted isn't it ha j/k fine fine w/e if you want leave it do it you know what i wish we would stop doing i got a call from the lady who reviews the cast stuff USING CAPITAL LETTERS TO DESCRIBE THINGS she basically told me it was to slutty she had to change the last sentence it was funny when i talked to her from/to where do we use caps? "PRINT, EMAIL, SAVE" NO HASSLE CHA CHA CHA FREE AND MEH meh "i say, meh" lol where? oh in my shit yeah cause it is SimpleC WRITE the caps note that it is an application within the program that's how i look at it see what i'm saying otherwise its just a fucking word its like branding our shit or something we don't list it that way in the program werd those could stand to change how long will it take you to put the text of the email advert together with the graphics? the original constraint is no longer a constraint not long i think why i am sending jason a first draft of the email and would like to put it in the graphics he is sending along to beryl just for sho send me the text and i'll copy it in aight it'll be a bit tell scott bears have been on the news all afternoon yeah? in what form? black bears running around trenton ha give me a word count for each section of the email count them yourself ha fucker i dunno what that is thro it into word i can't copy and paste cause its just an image 126 yeah something like that oh yhou did it with titles werd i got it i'm on it what the hell is that directly connect with me can't garbage ok emailing the first paragraph is one line too short and the second paragraph is five lines too long um deal with it? no five lines too long? yes the first one i can fix "SimpleC features large, single-click buttons with clear text and graphics to keep you pointed in the right direction. Additionally, SimpleC includes step-by-step ""How-To"" lessons to guide you through any process, one step at a time." last paragraph fine what do you think i can rework the first paragraph however the features that i would mostly talke about are email but i hesitate to do so because we show a file button it's fine i fixed it ok i have one other revision "SimpleC organizes all your computer needs into three areas: the Top Bar provides instant access to SimpleC applications (web, write, games, show, date, memo), the Left Bar allows you to print, email, save and more, the Main Screen serves as the workspace for all applications. This format allows you to quickly become comfortable with the computer, giving you more time to learn and explore." first paragraph only diff is the first sentence shouldn't those be seperated with semicolons? um you're guess is probably better than mine do it up FUCK its raining is it? are you having a pool party this weekend ? yes come food ok what day getting a keg of Sierra Nevada Saturday transportation/ ? maria she not bringing others/ ? dunno ask her what's the disclaimer?

or presentations w/e same diff making a change isn't all that easy mon frere mon frere ? mon fr�re yes what does it mean literally? my brother are you sreious is it that hard the level of difficulty isn't so much as the amount of work that has to be redone you have to start from the beginning of any particular element difficult to just update you could remote into my machine and use flash on here using Virtual PC? using remote desktop xp using what machine oh i was thinking if you had a xp pro emulator running you might be able i would but it would be mindnumbing Apple just released Remote Desktop 2 which i believe lets you control windows machines that's pretty hot but it's more expensive than flash ha all this shit should be free wait... then we'd never make money ha wait... we don't make money on Apple's servers LO)L on Apple's servers they have every program they make for FREE little did i realize how much i haad but that was before they had things like FCP 4 and Logic and Remote Desktop 2 which IS utterly hot btw you can control up to 50 machines at once that's nuts http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/ http://www.reflective.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/imri/forum/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=11194&st=&&#entry109916 ask and ye shall receive yeah i was thinkin since you are going to live with them there grandmasterdjs that you should have less complaining to do oh i'll probably find something to gripe about right albeit less complaining thank him for me helps me work np i will i'm backing up all the SMSC materials nice i have like 6 gigs now next time you are in the office dump all that shit to a machine putting it on my external HD everything that too that way it exists in multiple places "program, website, printed... all graphics" yo suzanne asked if we should bring anything saturday um good question one sec what we have already: "hamburgers, hot dogs, wings, leg of lamb, mac & cheese, red beans & rice, twizzlers, a half keg of Sierra Nevada, probably a handle of vodka, rum, and maybe scotch" chips maybe? ummm yeah... chips... potatoe salad? and we have a salad bacon potatoe salad? yes dan quayle that would be awesome ok you already have regular potato salad? or regular salad nope regular green salad but i have no idea how big it is ok hour and a half to compress and three minutes to copy waht's that Smiling_Screens_62304.zip have you heard from jason? no i like the end of this mix ok what's else to do ? what have you done taken the screenshots and backed up the files nie nice alright i'm about to swithc offices http://www.gfxartist.com/community/member_gallery/44673?continue=true umm too much time on his hands? dude that's amazing what he did what's up' working on neocyde.net what's up with you jasons says you have an entire list of things to do that he went over with you before he left i did them "additionally, can you mail out a copy of the most recent bellsouth presentation with the most recent flash presentation integrated to scott sameer jason and myself" do you want it before or after your changes before yup jason is reviewing the flash and my changes now and should be calling me shortly and/or sending out an email with HIS changes k you made all the changes to simplec.com already? i think so ok i haven't added the videos right hook that up after you email out the presentation i don't want to put up the original flash presentation if we're going to have a new one finished within days it is of immediate concern it is needed to secure funding it is needed by tomorrow end of day but has been requested sent immediately then use what you've got i'd rather put the second one up there than the first if it's absolutely necessary "right, the one we have now?" "yes, with the blue background, not the white" right with the screenshot flying in from below right on the website ? what's the fucking rush we are missing each other not on the website emailed out to scott jason sameer and myself inside the bell south presentatoin i would suggest using the one we have now and just slowing it down in the places i noted slap it into the ppt presentation and email it iout slowing it down is a general thing fine "it takes a while to slow it down in ""places" fine general then i wouldn't consider it worth your time to take the time to do it in specific places was jason able to play it? not yet can you put the www.simplec.com web address on the brochure sometime? or do you not think that makes sense? i don't even remember what the brochure looks like alrihgt nevermind i'm sending this to you to see if it works my copy of powerpoint doesn't support active x which means that i can't embed the control in the presentation from here i've put it in a link to a web page as far as i know the PSC movie is still embedded see if it works you finished the group order forms? or are those even on your radar the what order forms group? right for instance and organization i assume you've never heard of this fugetuboutit no idea did you get anything back from zamer yet? no should the flash take up the full screen in the ppt ? "um, i was displaying it at half size because the powerpoint presentation size is dependent on the size of the screen it's being displayed on and the flash gets resized in any event" ok so should it be sized to the full screen scott says its a control and wants to know whether or not to size it at full or half screen 462 X 334 in a block that's not full screen ok so within the ppt slide yup not at full slide right anything beyond that do you care/ try to make it a round multiple of the size because otherwise the graphics gets distorted 25% 50% w/e original size is 924 X 668 are you coming in tomorrow? friday what number are you at now home ............. 8568456586 alright man... talk to you tomorrow time to go talk to some seniors later i want my powerbook now what are you waiting for>? i don't really know go get it http://www.gofishpictures.com/GITS2/ they don't have any there who doesn't computer connection when do they get more what am i watching? ghost in the shell 2 whattup looking at recipes for a mint julep werd i don't believe i have any use for a superdrive k can you think of any uses? maria uses hers like it's going out of style i use mine to back up my shit right... but i would use an external for that external hd? yeah what does maria use hers for? copying dvds like movies? yes i thought that was difficult to do tedi does it all the time really well i thought htere was some issue with them not fitting on regular dvdrs "in light of this information, i will have to investigate further" you run them through a processor to get them down to one disc lose quality? some noticable/ ? um do they play on dvd players? honestly i don't know some there's a list of what they will play on gotcha i'll have to check it out yeah i don't do it you are a quite useful friend because i really do think it's a pain in the ass HA quite the useful yeah tedi's a little more into it werd i'll have to speak with mr tedi he'll be back next week where he be? in the woods nice 2898.63 for WHAT "12""powerbook + 20"" cinema display" ah that's with tax included there releasing new displays in like a week really yes are they supposed to be better? 20 inch is going to be smallest/cheapest 20 in 23 in 30 in yeah that studio display is lave lame do you have a website link that has info http://www.thinksecret.com/news/newdisplays.html yo g what's up nada where you at what's the schedule for manan a suzanne's if you want to swim come round 2 actually you're coming with maria well who wanted me to tell you to call her i'm comin with maria ahh ok will do how did your day go? fucked up y didn't succeed at what i was working on php mailer sucked php? yeah for SEO? yeah what's PHP web language ok dynamic pages connecting to databases you need to use it in an email? an automated email function triggered by a web form ah did you see the flash> ? and all i was trying to do was preserve the line breaks ? flash?

"20"" - $1300" "23 "" - $2000" "30"" - 3300" plus a $600 graphics card to drive it because no other graphics card can that's completely stupid "so for a 20" you have to spend 1900? no the card is just for the 30 inch takes up two DVI ports running in parallel damn yeah oh i fixed that thing write files y nice i don't think there's much more you could do to it "yeah, i'm not going to mess with it much more until we get a new version of the software" right with the green line and all the new buttons is jason back? no\ we might end up just skipping over that interation that was almost three months ago now i think yeah started to get new ideas already any effect on the prices for the current monitors/ ? they'll probably drop to clear inventory any idea when? when are the new ones available? next month any other earth shattering news? nothing suprising http://www.apple.com/ that 30 is huge yeah http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html what's the good word finally coming around from the weekend how are you doing? just fine pookie is in town i heard with his girlfriend dixie heard that too i think they may visit me today pookie and dixie Marvel Comics dixie and pookie or maybe just the funny pages yes either that or i was going to come to the city will probably call in a few hours and see what they're up to werd http://www.shimanoxtr.com/# i wish we could do sites like that why can't we for a different product maybe for ourselves is this what you were looking for? the part? eh i'll show you the exact part http://store.airbomb.com/mmASCTEST/Images/large/q/CR5158.jpg what is it keep in mind that part is 175 mm long made of aluminum how long is 175 mm? less than a foot ~8-9 inches and why do you want them? just one because the one i have is stripped out on the inside what is it? crank arm the pedal attaches to one end ok "the other end to the font gears,," and you already have these basically "yes, i ahve the complete set" ok can you get just one? yep $50 for that one piece the other side looks like this http://store.airbomb.com/mmASCTEST/Images/large/q/CR8440.jpg oh shit it comes with the gear attached? one side i guess that side is more expensive http://bike.shimano.com/product_images/FC/ev_images/EV-FC-M760-2261.pdf yes it is that is a complete set hahaha but that is the new complete set i will buy after getting this part wait what? the advantage being that the one i just showed you has an axle all the way through you're going to buy a new part sell it and buy the whole thing? right http://bike.shimano.com/product_images/FC/ev_images/FC_M571_EV.pdf see how this last one does not have the piece of metal going towards teh other side? specifically... there is no perpendicular tube attached to part #8 on the last one ok "vs, the first schematic which has #8 with a tube" the tube makes it what stronger lighter more durable less parts etc because in the case of the second version there is an entire part they build with bearings and shit packed into it that goes between #8 and #9 ah the difference is noticable? yeah superior design and i imagine that it will last longer and require less maintenance and eliminate the problem i have with the current model which is the stripping? right stripped because of lack of post which was caused by part #9 coming loose from the part which the post replaces i see the bike won't look much different are you riding outside of just back and forth to Penn? outside as well http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=42317&item=3684895317&rd=1 check out how cool that one looks that's the step up from what i'm getting hmmm i've always been a fan of gunmetal gray right i wish i had all the money in the world i woudl buy it and it is also 60 grams lighter one for the bike and one for the desk yeah http://i16.ebayimg.com/01/i/02/07/98/f4_1.JPG what's thatA? the entire assembly used but gives you an idea of what it looks like put together not on a bike what's it made out of Al are the teeth supposed to bend like that? you mean in a different pic where they look like waves? no this last one you sent me the teeth look bent http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=56193&item=3685041796&rd=1 yeah i see what you mean no those chainrings will have to be replaced that comes from the tension of pedalling do you really end up beating the shit out of it like that? yeah the inside of the rings looks worse cause that's where the chain rubs to move to the next gear in a year he did that AND he still is getting $150 for them nuts yeah high end bike parts dude they are made to be light and strong that thing new costs $500 you could buy an entire bike why was the gray one only 350? the model i'm going to buy? cause it weighs 60 grams more essentially no the one step up OH More not Less weighing more costs you less weighing less costs you more right i can't read jason's handwriting neither can i is he gone for this week as well? back sometime later this week neat what ya need? nothing really just wondering how much longer i have to play around with stuff what stuff most everything is fair game right now just whatever comes to mind yeah i thought you meant handwriting that shit makes no sense i sent you what i could figure out all you're supposed to do is make the buttons right? probably i'm not messing with it though that's not really a spec as much as it is a cocktail napkin right the old lcd's aren't even on the apple website "the 17"" is" right you'll probably have to get it from a reseller who want's that piece of garbage ha not for 700 that's for sure http://www.macmall.com/macmall/families/powerbook/ don't think that's better than computer connection not at all actually $1400? that's for a 1ghz ah "for the 1.33, it's $5 lower than from apple's site" "before you take into account the ""FREE"" stuff" did they really just drop the price? who apple? yeah they're price is the same "$1,599 " for the 12 combo vs the macmall's 1594 what a deal LOL i was checking to see if the monitors had been relisted yet and an entire $105 on the old monitors from macmall which is still more than the computer connections 2 weeks ago i'll have to see if computer connection is goign to drop their price where are you now? by the pool bastard going to go back inside and watch the keynote i think what are you up to? penn sittin lol ? everything macmall has is $5 cheaper what a discout extra memory too tho yeah i guess compared to apple its cheaper with that considered but not compared to computer connection which gives you the 12 combo with applecare for $1540 and the extra 512 costs you $120 "$8,122.95 " ?

on the brochure? where do you think i don't know. you might want to refresh the text on the back yeah i totally agree is this one of the things youare supposed to be doing? or just putzing around/ "there's not much ""supposed to be doing"" at this point" as far as i know alrgith i'm going to need your hellp on making a press document basically taking the NYTimes article "and blowing it up to full page, using the front page and section titles" when are you in the office next?

"outside of that, jason takes his side and feels like he has to get his way" that right there is impossible to do literally the box falls off the screen and the next button isn't all there and he didn't even look at it and he's insisted on it three times i don't think i'm being unreasonable when i point stuff like that out some of the other stuff is negotiable like the step by step and i really don't think putting a mask over everything all the time is going to help overall but even that is something we can discuss but the demanding and getting angry over it is getting to be unreasonable for me it doesn't improve my day to have these kinds of discussions and it might not even be worth the experience it needs to be more of a discussion of getting to learn more about this that's it if we keep having to hate on each other i dunno i think he's probably frustrated/tired from his trip no excuse nope sorry anyway it's more than just this trip i know it's classic bad management and i'm not blameless at ALL but i know when i'm being abuse d "when you don't do what is requested, supply a reason/logic" because it does come off as if you are simply disregarding/ignoring "on the other side of that coin... the recipient should ask ""why did you not do...." "yeah, i mean, should i really write up a justification for every piece that i submit?" that seems excessive if you are specifically not completing a requested item and not necessarily write up but somehow explain why it just took me two hours to write that email for four points right it woudl have taken 10 minuts to talk about maybe 25 with the presentation in hand i'm calling jason.... i don't even know where he is brb k when can you come to philly next? i'm in philly right now ahhh good times he's still in dc supposed to call me back shortly i'm moving back into this city in a month "and, as i guessed.... has been dealing with complete incompetence" listen i am anything but incompetent i know that but it's hard to transition between the two....... at least for him apparently cause he does have to list things out step by step for others holding their hands and then he tries to do that with you.. which does not apply micromanaging is not going to work in his facor favor in any event sure but he has to do that with others its pathetic that's an HR issue yeah but really there's too much to do for too few people i don't think it's as much of an HR issue as it is a psychological issue because the people who are doing TEA stuff are idiots Ha and he's having to micro manage that shit Dan. You know i will not be micromanaged i know this ok i think that's a big part of it that he tries to cause he has to with them so much he just keeps on steamrollin and doesn't realize that he shouldn't and that it works against him wasting time/effort this is really it though it has to change or business changes between us right and really it's just business if someone were hired on a contract basis.... it might work better just giving them tasks if they were not responsible for original ideas i think that's an amazingly bad idea given the way we delegate work and the way work gets processed no one would ever get paid for getting something done because "most things are never ""done" around here "right, either that, or we would pay 5 times for one thing" right and you would end up with a very limited vision they don't realize this believe me jason does NOT want to make the decisions that i make for him if he goes much farther upstream he's going to end up with shit on his desk of his own doing "i think it's reasonable to say that i'm a better artist than he is, and he has said it himself many times." so micromanaging my art with his vision ends up with the shitty vision that's logical right? but if he see's soemthing as open for improvement fine such as emphasizing the buttons or whatever he's not open to alternatives and when were into details like this and i keep saying this it's mostly arbitrary and really i'm supposed to be the one that makes the call over what's arbitrary i know that for me it makes it much clearer if only the button in question is light up because i'm supposebly the professional in this regard and if you read my response i say that's fine on that specific issue... but i also understand the difficulty but the technical issues outweighted the strength of clarity right "ok, but i'm still getting taken to the mat for making that call" because you didn't explain at all you are half right i didn't have the opportunity to explain there was no discussion there were no questions there was a request and a response there was a submission which did not fulfill without explanation as to why then a reactionary reponse to the lack of fullfillment if it were a verbal conversation it would have been smooth a question would have followed if it were a verbal argument a reaction would have followed now we're having an argument instead of a conversation and i'm not the one that's caused it no he did the situation did whatever the solution is to tlak about it instead of shooting arrows this is why i can't talk to sameer though it's the same pattern and if it's really going to be like that with jason then i'm only realizing it right now and it's not acceptable with sameer its acceptable because i never have to work with sameer with jason i'm sorry but i hate being dragged down into this kind of drama basically jason should have discussed instead of throwing it back end of discussion ok right? i'm going to to take a walk that's what i think do that i'll be here until i get ahold of roxana call jason did you call jason going to finish my snickers bar first lol do that you'll need the engergy i'm going to play squash with gzo k take it out on the squash ball might be a sinking ship everyone should jump off of anyway.. i'm seeing red talk to you later i'm not going to argue with him if he gets foolish with me i'm going to hang up and that will be it i think you would have been better to tell him why you didn't do what we requested when you submitted it that's the only thing i can say ok i don't necessarily agree with either of you its a process problem whatever time to smack something i'll talk to you laters howzit decent yiou?? ditto i was walkin all over NYC yesterday with the fam see anything fun? not really LOL some ass right other than that the normal shit weekend was a bit of madness well... the normal tourist shit right that's fun to me tho dude yes waiting in line at th empire state building not fun LOL ok TRUE i guess you can't pay to get to the head of the line like you can at six flags eh you can actually oh yeah? sign up for some package guided shit or something meh ripoff it wasn't that much faster wait for tix wait for elevator wait for next elevator LOL wait to get down wait to get down the next elevator "yeah, the down part is what gets me i think" what a scam who picked that excursion? "central park, plaza hotel, trump tower, 5th ave, Ground Zero, statue of lib" all kinds of shit um parents it was their first time to nyc all of them parents and brother OH how much fun for them then yeah its funny "cause they're like..

completely i cornered scott when i got to the office and HE was shaking and i got exactly what i wanted and haven't talked to them since i've dealt with so much bullshit anyway "so, any software you have that belongs to them" the keys the graphics i gave scott the keys excellent the software should be in that drawer the graphics are on this disc when i get my check and my shares which i should probably just burn fuck that cash the check ha oh i'll cash it just to see if it's good what are banks policies on checks written to cash?

"by the way,,, ichat is the shit" ha this i know "no,, you have to use an intermediary language" now we really need cameras such as coldfusion "yeah, seriously" or webobjects i've got one actually and so does gonzo i have a camera at my apt too actually dunno how well it would work with the apple but anyway if it's firewire it will work fine this is the exact situation gzo and I were talking about he knows the back end i know the front end and overall project management etc "yeah, developing web services for small business is definitely an underserved market at this moment" will last for maybe 5 more years decent money the strictly funny thing about all of this is that I think I'm doing this on a project basis managing it myself though incorporate as a consultancy pay no taxes live in tahiti once you develop one framework you can carbon copy it for a specific market like real estate revenue wise trick is to do it cheaply i guess because that's where the market will shake itself out "eh, maybe not" at least not right now "if you do it well, i bet you can charge an ass load" ok going to go beat jak and daxter #2 fun game on the phone with suaznne heh alright talk more later laters what a crazy bitch "anyway," yeah ha i heard frank is back with his oh great hopefully he is luckier than I eh you should have heard me cussing when i found out loud profanity ok i'm off laters get to work slacker "i'm taking pictures of models, leave me alone" ahhh bastard mental pictures i'm sure "digital, but that's neither here nor there" what's up with you nada working on this damn pre-loader still yes? "or loader, as scott would insist" yeah... it's pissing me off are you at SEO? yes i've been sorting invoices for two days i'm almost done that sounds horrible these bills are a small catasrophe i'm going to end up going back to the first of the year and redoing it all damn they've been doing their purchase orders by hand good luck with that meh jesus H it finally worked ? ha what was the prob? the problem is that you can do this in any number of ways and i wanted to do it my way i have yet to completely grasp the best ways to work with flash "in terms of scenes, embedded movie clips, etc" but scenes was the final success route ah are you going to leave it the way it is? leave what the way it is? the code eh maybe i might play around a little more ha but i'm happy with the general state i didn't show you the mock up intros ? http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/IntroGrey.html http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/IntroBlack.html i like the grey i knew it don't like the rotate yeah i didn't know how to get it from the middle to the corner a slide looks worse IMO any ideas? flowers grow skip the rotate and just grow the flower from the corner? yeah http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/IntroductionBlack.html http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/IntroductionGrey.html i like the way it grows from the right the one in the center is odd shifts to the right that's odd after it comes to the foreground? or during its transition "also, do you notice any ""boxes"" around the images?" no boxes werd when it comes to the foreground it pushes the kappa farther than the sigma that's what your eyes tell you nevermind you're right the kappa is just wider "yay, our wireless reaches to the train station" dude i'm getting hit on my 50 year old women decent looking how much money would someone have to pay you for you to let them puke in your mouth "$15,000 " who's asking? amongst the office "my threshold was 10,000" what's the average? "well, the inital question was for 5 million" i was like... yes.... twice "i figured in a $5,000 asshole tax" "$5,000,000, no question" do they have aids? nop e how much would it take if they had aids "$30,000,000 and a stomach pump" if you were in a pool up to your neck in puke and someone threw a bag of diarrhea at your face... would you duck? "if you were in a pool of puke, you'd probably start to disintegrate" ok smartass from teh acid yeah but not that quick quick enough to get out lol see. the thing i don't get with flash is what the best methods are for changing pages for example cause you could make a page a movieclip... or a frame... or a scene personal preference does it not affect the size of the swf? i've read things that acknowledge that the difference is small nah same objects diff code i think yeah brb aight back not sure how large to make this page i have it at 550 pixels now afraid that if i go to 725 or so... the swf will get to large that's big enough suggestions? werd that's the default yeah even with my monitor on 1280X 1024 i see things fine flash is supposed to display the same on all browsers... correct? yes that's what still gets me.. julian said that when he viewed the grey animation "that there were ""boxes"" around the graphics as they moved" maybe the version of flash? maybe that's what i thought you saw the one with the menu rollovers.. right? y how's your day goin? it's very business like day i'll be on the phone with accounts receivables all day i already had to basically tell off paula quietly for suggesting that i'm responsible for not knowing why this mess exists haha are you getting compensated well for this crap? NO oh well the money is shit experience? resume yeah werd it's not particularly hard just pushing mountains of paper are you going to have time to look at flash stuff while you are on the phone? what's up with you yeah werd sure i'll send you a link to the menu i just finished in a bit k http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/menu.html what a pain in the ass that was the menu? yeah y ? just tedious i like the intro transition but not the exit yeah.. it should reverse out is that waht you were thinking? y yeah "well, when they pay me 3000 for the site... i'll do it then" ha i can do it.... just didn't want to too much thinking yeah i think i've started to cut my losses already i'm not going to get anxious about this shit right just a job man a yob i don't think the menu looks too too bad... just would be better if it reversed out the rollover is great "it was weird, i tried to assign onOver and onRollOut behaviors to each rollover movie clip,,, but it would get all screwed up... so i had to put a button over each movie clip" that's what i did for neocyde.net and then just used instances of the same movie clip.. right? basically you know what's good about this job? ? ok.. i'll guess.... the 50 yr old ladies that hit on you at the bus stop no ew haha the interns fool wait you have interns? many hot ones you would say yes i'm gonna have to come do lunch with you if you like we'll see what do you think about the sub menu font size..etc they're fashion design students jeebus yeah not exactly destitute i think its grainy http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/menu.html better? much maybe increase the kerning yea what a pain ha soon i will do this in actionscript or at least that's what i tell myself right what are you doing tonight? no plans yet gzo had mentioned maybe hangin out a liquor monter's place what you up to? bear is here not familiar he wanted to see g-zo and hopkins know of him don't know him but i'm down to hang out "yeah, i'm ditching asao" asap werd YO i could potentially ditch whenever yes? i just had this confrontation about vacation/sick days what about "the fact that she was like, ""one week is standard" and it took me a WEEK to get her to say it are you on salary? yes that's nice benefits? "and she said ""we don't take sick days" benefits MAYBE after 6mo - 1 year "wait.. so if you get sick, it cuts into your vacation?" i asked her that the real problem is that you can't nail her down on anything whatever and these are pretty simple questions she said " people just make up the day" because i said i'm not taking a day of my week's vacation if i'm sick and really i'm insisting on two weeks "because for 25K, i'm getting two fucking weeks of vacation, i don't care what fucking industry it is" she said after 3 months we'll talk about it i think she feels like that even talking about it is annoying or presumptive and i'm like listen dude she just doesn't want to give away the bank on the first day work with her for a while ease into it if she's still stubborn about it in a month then you have a problem you have a legitimate point she knows that but doesn't know how to handle the situation she's intimidated by the fact that you have a legitimate point.. you know it... and you are smart enough to out-negotiate her on it "i tried to tell her that me going to business school was going to work out for her in the long run, but she's definitely not used to dealing with it" you mean having gone to b-school? right right "she's smart enough to agree tho,,, right?" she really doesn't have any conception of how bad her books are in her own way she really work like i was trying to work with Jason "like ""everything will work itself out" "instead of ""lets do this methodically" eyah that doesn't work out so well ha in certain areas we worked it out i told her it has to be this way for a while because if i'm not superorganized it's not going to ever become automated exactly "sounds like a situation where things need to be ""laid out" like... listen here lady... you may not know this... but i'm the best thing to come your way in a long time and you're trying to shaft me over like i'm a regular idiot "which, obviously , i am not" but i know that you don't want to give everything away... I just want a reasonable situation for both of us blah blah blah EXACTLy that's what i said it has to be mutual or i'm going to get frustrated and we both don't want that right you'd leave "which, would set her back, yet again" kerning isn't showing up when i preview no idea could be a bug "if i were to make it reverse, do you think it should reverse while the new one comes out, or sequentially.. reverse, then come out" um quicker is better in most cases yeah for a menu same time i don't think the reversing out will work so well because what would i do with the sub menu while the new submenu comes out that can just go away and have the menu items moving at the same time y how far are you into actionscript in terms of controlling movieclips and such not very ? playing trying to get this shit to work out like i want there are so many tutorials out there but they are limited in scope they tell you how to do one specific thing "and, of course, i always want to do it my way" yeah slow goin but enough to feel like i'm getting somewhere DUDE! who has a copy of office XP i can steal? you gotta check this out ? http://www.collegeatupenn.com/~sigkap/menutest.html go to sisterhood ha neat yeah so insignificatn nt but... still office xp? oh sorry gzo lemme call him tx what you doin after work getting wasted? he has wanna come over? what you need xp for? access over to your place? yeah i'll pick up bear office xp is gzo coming ? yes bbq? sure werd ok leaving here soon call me km gzo and I are going to be around 42nd and spruce when i said my place i meant suzanne's when you call we will arrange food and liqs k hi burc it's maria heya what's up I'm on mikee's pooter yeah mine's in the shop noticed :P that sux what you do to it? smartaass nada recalled white spots on the screen ahhhh and my backlight broke awhile ago so... damn I know she needed a check up it's so frickin HARD tho "but I figured better now than when I really need it, u know?" yea definitely so u busy? eh not too much why we got to get u those boxes when? yes tonight? wanna come over and I'll drive u home with them? u can have dinner with me and the edge tomorrow can we do tomorrow? sure! no problem excellent k it's a date tomorrow it is :) "then this weekend we movin, right?" right k Ima call Frank tonight his test is in a couple of days werd tell him i said hello and good luck but mebbe he'll come down do you have a lot to move oh yes u do stereo and shit nah don't pester him to come down ooooh i wanna do it my own pace Well wes then werd k wes and i not too too much stuff k kool i'm just gonna get jason's van Friday night was somethin lol yeah yeah it was sigh I went off and got drunker and I'm gonna do it again tonight! :P damn woman what you doing? going to Soma dancing drinking school starts again soon so I gotta move my ass.. hahaha did u rest on sat? yeah didn't do anything good burc ?

I was thinking about it metaphysically but physically it's very clean good for fundraising :) ? ;) old fat rich women will love yeah and give money back to their sisters blah blah blah :P "i mean,,, i couldn't really put tooo mcuh creativity in it" cause it has to be logical and intuitive right and all that shit for idiots and its not your own can't assume anything yeah right but i'm happier and happier with it it's an amazing first pieve piece I cant even IMAGINE how to begin its a pain in the ass... lemme tell you o? I do wanna learn esp when you feel locked into a certain way after you got like 1/50th done you're like.. shit.. now i'm moving forward with this concept... but wait...wait....WAIT>........ maybe i could have done it differently pays to have good design background or at least awareness wow i've been reading all kinds of print and digital media design shit i feel so gay artistic integrity is a bitch .. actually... i don't OH STOP that's not GAY burx i'm all about this shit lol BURX LOL burc I have to poop i kinda like burx haha werd mee too BURX MAN no wireless yet?? lol OH YES BUT mikee talks to me while pooping I can't i guess you don't care like that just kidding I don't wanna have a good one k Ima do some shit yeah I'll chit chatter with you later yepyyep TOMORROW oui? yes k si si si adios ciao besitos we still on for tonight? yup sure I have a two pm meeting ok but then afterward and that affects teh prices of noodles in thailand how? whachu wanna do? i dun care pick u up or u come here? either way... i can ride bike there and back or trolley there and ride with you back how many boxes u gots ? lots? um yeah about 10 at least but there the smaller ones sounds good yea? yeah i'll take what I can get alright so what are we doing?

Prior to founding OQO, Jory worked in Apple Product Design, where he was one of the primary product designers of the G3 Powerbook line and co-conceived theTitanium Powerbook. Jory was previously at IBM's Almaden Research Center, developing new portable computing hardware for IBM's ThinkPad line. Jory also worked at MIT, developing moored oceanographic instruments for climate change research. Jory has patents pending for inventions in Powerbooks, iBooks and OQO computers. Jory received three simultaneous B.S. degrees from MIT in earth atmospheric and planetary studies (EAPS), visual design, and literature." "Jory received three simultaneous B.S. degrees from MIT in earth atmospheric and planetary studies (EAPS), visual design, and literature." he's an ass too how do you know?

yes external? no gotcha http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.aspx?pid=download&location=/mac/DOWNLOAD/MISC/RDC.xml&secid=80&ssid=9&flgnosysreq=True neat who knew "the internet my son, the internet" so how do i turn it on in windows? wait you need to connect to your mac from a windows machine? no from windows to mac no from mac to windows right.. oh oh oh right hold on a second.. lemme look you're running xp right/ ? yes control panel system remote tab Allow users to connect remotely to this computer you're going to crap your pants when you see how easy it is to connect using the mac i remmeber when i set it up on my dell.. it took forever all types of dumbass settings and what not when i did it on the mac... i just used the full computer name do you have to have a static ip> good question i dunno the answer probably? how did you find out the address of the computer you were logging into? it tells you the computer name right there on that remote tab should i be able to import .wav files using itunes and convert to aac? i think i may have to ditch this fucking job sure why ditch the people are a major pain in the ass and it's not very much money to put up with that right it logs me out i can't work on both at the same time? what do you mean? two users right numbnutz one machine two machines one user you can work from your mac using your mac and the windows through the mac but.. you may not use the windows machine through the windows machine if you are also using it through the RDC dammit why would you want to? three monitors? who knows because it keeps me from having to log in it doesn't make any sense it DOES make sense i like my mac ok.. i'm sure this is one of those crazy things you want to do for some crazy reason that doesn't make any sense to me but is completely sensible to you it keeps me from having to LOG IN in both places you log in on one machine "i don't understand why you would want to use two computers physically, simultaneously" if you can use the windows machine through the mac then you have control over two computers via one machine really i just want to sit here and watch the cursor move while i use my mac remote control oh no its a virtual login numbnutz i knew it was something silly fuck you i could have three monitors doesn't work like that taht wouldn't make any sense anyway you would have to connect external monitors to your mac remember/? this entire thing is about how you like using your mac so much all i'm saying is that it should be possible in fact i thought that was the whole idea no the idea so that you could log into another computer is and take it over to connect REMOTELY not while you're sitting next to the fucker and it's to connect to the machine.... not the monitor assmaster "yeah, but what happens when i want to fix someone else's computer while they're sitting there?" just as if you were without your computer you log in they log out that's how the game works the admin takes over the machine... fixes the bitch.... and returns it to the peon server user not server i still wish i could see the cursor move so you could show someone else how to fix it plug the monitor into your computer then remotely oh you can do taht with a separate piece of software VNC I have that capability but i can only watch the other person's machine as they use it due to fucking bullshit ass restrictions as if i'm going to break the machine or something "but yeah, i can spy on the guy i work with" although it is pretty apparent when you machine starts to lag "oh, and i was trying to import wma, not wav" so i think i'm outta luck in that department yes try real maybe heh i can control my itunes from where? mac uhhh yeah.. why wouldh't you be able to control your itunes from your mac? iTunes on Windows like the volume and shit with the rdc? yup no shit assmaster how do youo think i was making my laptop talk at ssi when i was here at seo go into the speech utility you can type something and have the computer say it so it's all ghost like i still think you should be able to have more than one user logged in at once you can not with this tho but you can't complain about this.. since it's free but I guess you can complain about anything "yeah, it's decent" Paula's right though using my Mac is a damned distraction because you make it so but yeah i need MS Office 2003 ?

A positronium ""atom"" (as physicists dub it) consists of an electron and antielectron, orbiting each other.

"oh, nah, the cord for my powerbook" oh got it i thought you were jjust going to bring it over here? everything but i'm going to tie it down to the post in my armoire so i have options with the music esp late late got it your costume makes suzanne sick ha literally? "how would he feel if one of his friends was raped..." "is he looking to offend people?" tell her it's halloween and it's supposed to be scary what scares adults? rape she says she's gonna go as Matthew Shepard neat lol i'm going to leave that one alone yeah she's all worked up now jeebus i expect some of this at the party "whenever somebody launches into it, i'm going to walk up to them and say ""Boo." yeah i dunno "what's more, nobody will ever forget what costume i had on" i guess i'd be afraid of someone getting reallly pissed cause 1 in 4 women has been i'm expecting it that's half the fun "much, much better than getting no reaction at all" it's the perfect idea aight i think i agree with suzanne on this one to tell you the truth i don't even think she's coming now you think you could possible talk me out of it? no not at all "well, maybe... but i think you're too stubborn to be talked out of anything" and it really isn't my place at least now i know it works yeah if that's what you're going for there will be all kinds of reactions tedi's friends all laughed right "it could be the worst idea in the history of bad ideas, but even that makes it worth doing" is she really not coming? prob not you too? who knows does she want to talk about it? i'm gonna say no she's upset with me at the moment not related to halloween.. i've just been bugging her and she needs to get work done "regarding the costume, i think it would probably make her uncomfortable regardless of any talking about it" i think it might help if she at least understood why i decided to do it i don't know if that's true "it's the fact that other people will see it and have their ""reactions"", and that it is inevitable that it trivializes the crime/victim" "you, as the wearer, cannot prevent that from happening" i disagree. i think it's cause for discussion of something serious at a party? i don't think it's an appropriate forum yeah it probably does trivialize it. i guess i'm not bothered by that the artistic statement behind it is powerful rape is trivialized by the evening news it's social commentary the evening news is not dressing up in a costume at a party they are reporting the events nah they're selling soap put this in context it's a halloween party it's not a costume ball at a costume ball it would be completely inappropriate but the point of halloween is to celebrate everything that's wrong with culture put it in this context if a girl is at your party and there is someone dressed as rape "and people are laughing at it, regardless of whether or not their laughter is rooted in discomfort, ignorance, immaturity" it will inevitably make that girl uncomfortable it's your party you can do whatever you want i'm not saying anything against that just don't expect everyone to think it's appropriate and do expect people to be repulsed by it not like ewww... that's gross repulsed... "more like, what kind of mind thinks that is even close to OK, how is it possible that all these people are standing here thinking that it's OK" the kind of person you're describing is both judgemental and insecure and that's not the type of person i cater to ok "i don't think anyone should be ""secure"" with the topic of rape" i do certainly that's ridiculous "no, it isn't" fear of the issue is what causes it to happen respect for those who have endured it and have to deal with it on a daily basis if i had been raped and i saw someone dressed as rape at a party i really want you to explain to me how you are going to come up to me and tell me everything is ok such a person has to face that fear and be able to deny it fear? to ever be ok yeah one should never be ok with rape the fear of the act happening again there are other issues i'm not trying to justify rape just mock it that's deifnitely not the point and even if it isn't YOUR point to mock it "yeah, put it in a box and make it abstract" the fact that there is an entire party of people around you accepting it does "and you're tellin me that as a hypothetical rape victim, i'm supposed to be ok with that" "yes. i'm telling you that if you are ever going to be a whole person, you have to" i'll be ok with people discriminating blacks and gays and all that too we'll all be ok with it and accept it and set the stage to resume those practicies LOL now that's a little bit far mind social acceptance that's where all those are rooted nobody is going to think it's ok to rape someone because i wore this halloween costume and i'm not saying they will making fun of blacks and gays is exactly what halloween is about victims halloween is about terror or being the instrument of violence or making victims it works on SO MANY LEVELS halloween is how children lose their fear of all the things that scare them. so why is that wrong for adults? "yes, if you isolate your angle... that works" "but there are other angles which, in my mind, make it innappropriate" and that's why it is YOUR party "dude, i KNOW it's inappropriate." but that's the point! i just think that telling someone to not take rape seriously is fucked up "and essentially, that is what you have to do in order to go to a party where someone is dressed up as rape" i don't think you're taking rape seriously enough if you're limited to that point of view i'm taking it dead serious i don't think many people are actually going to think about the issue when they see it it isn't a question of how you are going to view yourself sure it is it is a question of how others will exactly! right who will get it? i don't know but even if five people out of 150 people get it then the idea is a success because it's communicated on the deepest levels regardless of the 145 you offend definitely that's what art is or at least one very important aspect of it for example: http://www.wetterlinggallery.com/archive/nathalia/nathalia_main.htm "Most people who see Nathalia's pictures for the first time are impressed by how beautiful they are. It takes a few seconds before you start to wonder how they have been made. A photo-montage? Some kind of digital manipulation? When you look closer, there is something slightly distorted in the rabbit's expression. Something slightly abnormal about the face of the cat. Slowly you realise that the animal is dead, that the animal has died for the sake of the picture. Is this acceptable? One can, of course, choose to think that it is always wrong to kill animals in the name of art. That nothing can defend Nathalia Edenmont. But if you feel more doubtful, we would very much like to explain Nathalia's reasoning, and how we at Wetterling Gallery argue when we exhibit her art. Art arouses thoughts and poses questions that are necessary. Nathalia's beautiful pictures are frightening in the same way that many other beautiful things hide some sort of suffering. One can enjoy beautiful exteriors, or one can go beneath the surface and find things that perhaps you do not want to know about. If Nathalia's pictures had been repugnant, it would have been easy to reject them. But now they are so beautiful - and the insight into the reality behind them gives rise to thoughts about people's shallowness and double standards. Many of us eat meat, wear leather or use make-up that has been tested on animals, without this arousing especially strong reactions. But when a picture shows a dead rabbit, all hell breaks loose. Nathalia grew up in the former Soviet Union, and she has a razor sharp eye for paradoxes and gaps in our western morals. She is not the first to use dead animals in her works of art - that has been done at least since the 1700s, but she is a contemporary debater who provokes questions which nowadays everyone should ask themselves. Her pictures tell lies in front of our faces, but they are not alone in this - the lies exist all around us every day, without us questioning them. There is nothing illegal in Nathalia's art. She has killed the animals in as humane a way as possible. Has she been guilty of a moral crime? We do not think so. We think that art is of vital importance."

We think that art is of vital importance. reading on the webpage now i get it i don't expect people to be comfortable with it and I don't know why one would go to a party where they were uncomfortable doesn't sound like a good time the type of people who i want at my party are people who will be ok with it even if they think it's distasteful aight "if maria and al and imri get pissed off about it, i'll just go as a housewife" go as what you want "nah, the party is all of ours" even though i'd enjoy being a problem i'm not going out of my way to annoy them "i think if anyone won't be ok with it, it will be al" i'll ask him what he thinks it's still a brilliant costume "well, let me know if you change your costume" ha seriously i know i just think it's funny i probably would too if it didn't seriously affect me you can tell suzanne that i think hating on someone's creativity is pretty criminal i'll not she isn't hating on it anyway... just doesn't want to be at the party "i'll go as matthew shepard""?" haha mocking my creativity seems valid to me par "nah, her intention is different" "she was making a good point, in my opinion" i thought it was a great example to put it in another perspective same as if i went as a black slave or a KKK member i think all of those are valid halloween costumes aight i think trying to be moral about halloween is pretty ridiculous and that's fine that's fine too we're free to do all that LOL yeah nobody told you not to do whatever you want "nah, you just made it three times harder to pull off" i did nothing of the sort sure you did "to pull something like this off, you have to own the idea" and casting doubt all over it makes it harder to pull off "if anything, i made it easier" cause you justified it to probably the toughest critic already believe me... you own it LOL "yeah, i'm tempted to do it now out of spite" that's fine too really personally i just don't give a shit when it comes down to it i'd go either way and for my second act i'll be playing the party of Joey Ramone "do i think it's appropriate, not really,, but that's just my opinion, and it wouldn't stop me from going" i dont' even know who joey ramone is didn't know who matthew shepard was that's more the angle i'm going for tolerance joey ramone was the front man for the quintessential punk bank band "dude,,, i get the experiement part of it" i get the artistic expression "and if it were not for this conversation, i wouldn't have given it much thought at all" "but, when i started to think about it,,, I didn't agree with it" that's all i just cannot get past the fact that that very reaction is the most raw expression of exactly what a scary fucking halloween costume is all about. halloween started as a celebration of the dead almost right halloween is a celebration of demons all-saints day is the day that follows all-souls day another related day some dude is IMing me in italian why he wants a copy of I Robot in Divx i have no idea where he got my nic werd weird very esp since i don't speak a word see what he thinks of your costume ;) i posted a topic on the forum i really wanted it to be a total surprise dude you should have but now i've got to take a poll fuck that i haven't told anyone what it's going to be just that it's controversial "right,,, that doesn't accurately get the point accross tho" "whatever,,," bottom line... just let me know what you decide i think Al's gonna balk i wonder why " Of course, there is such a thing as an inappropriate costume.Plenty of things are sacred, until they are belittled by human neglegence.Halloween is not a day meant to celebrate everything that is wrong with our culture. �Thanksgiving is more along those lines. imri is totally fine with it ok i'm doing it nobody seems to mind ok any idea where i can get monkey ears? the halloween store on columbus blvd maybe tonight it was a zoo i bet all i need is to go to the i goldberg and get some patches then i need monkey ears and tail also the philadelphia zoo they have a big monkey thing i think gotcha ah HA ? and so it begins http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=101184 that's cool I've been talking about this for at least five years.

people not accepting him ah "apparently he could take it anymore, after trying to force himself to be heterosexual for years" and broke down crying on a train it goes away pretty quickly that's good the hard part is your family yeah can't even begin to imagine lots of pressure one must put on oneself it's extremely frustrating for most ppl and then if your family doesn't accept it yeah anyway i was sorta talking to the guy i work with where is he from? just telling him that he has to be there for his friend i'm not sure yeah don't know much about this kid at all... just that he's a friend of my co-worker really what needs to happen is this kid needs to decide that he doesn't care what other ppl think exactly that's what i told ryuji OH MAN "http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-hunt24nov24,0,1227137.story?coll=la-home-headlines" yeha heard about that yesterday crazy huh?

ok i think he's prob guilty but i also think he's telling the truth he probably did shoot those guys in the back and then went back for more but damn you think they wouldn't have killed him? yeah they totally would have you're probably right if he gets a good lawyer definitely no injection ha "yeah, he's getting it prison stylez with a shank and a spoon up the anus" yow.... maybe he'll get to eat a whole chicken off another inmate? ;) something tells me he won't be the one who's eating you know what's totally awesome about the whole thing? it was this little dude from Laos against like 10 hunters on ATVs on their own land and he fucking HOUSED them ? yeah "well," he was a decorated marksman oh and i guess these other dudes who had been hunting all their lives were just poor shots TRUE http://fuggingitup.blogspot.com/2004/11/wonderfug-your-newest-superhero.html i'm starting to realize how fundamentally upset I am with Maria lol about how she's been acting towards just about everyone for the past 8 months i'm really worn out with her and i'm screaming at her all the time in my head which is a bad sign it's not even my drama but now it is yep because i really don't like who she is well to be honest i felt sorta the same way the other day when maria julian and I went to target like... i sort of felt bad because i was using her car... but i sorta feel the same yelling at her in my head thing... yeah and then the other day i went over to your house and was talking to her about suzanne which was good for me i needed to talk to someone and it was good of maria to do that for me but again... sorta felt guilty cause i'm yelling at her in my head hba don't feel guilty about it she is definitely a partner in that feeling that same day that you came over i went upstairs to see how she was doing and we were talking in the bathroom and i picked up her brush "and she said, ""Mikee, please just don't touch anything i'm using" what? total bitch is she going to get cooties? whatever i don't think she's happy with herself or maybe that's some lame ass put it off on her shit i dunno my problem is that i'm starting to not care at all yeah see for the past few months or so brb k ok back phone i've really had this feeling of dissappointment ? i dunno "i just thought she was more ""cool"" before" YES i basically decided i lost a lot of respect for her yeah and it's going to take a long time to get it back feels weird yeah like i'm judging my friends ha you know i dunno though i really tried hard its really awkward i mean i'm just coming to this conclusion and it's like creeping up on me not like i decided to be mad but just got really frustrated and then tired and then indifferent point is then you just feel like it's not even worth your time yeah and you get frustrated that you are wasting your time oh i've definitely wasted a lot of time but up to now i didn't mind even a little bit because it was just Maria being stupid but now she's different it's an ongoing characteristic and i'm wondering what i should do about it if anything i thought about talking to her about it "hA HA" yeah right yeah oh by the way yes? "TR, doesn't want to see you, Pete doesn't want to see you, Tedi doesn't want to see you, Wes doesn't want to see you (sometimes), and by the way, neither do I" that's what you woudl say] nah but that's what's implied yeah i have no idea what her deal is i could probably break it down her attitude pisses me off sometimes but again what's the pint point right i'm going to talk to Dan about it he's the only one who gets through to her oh GOD so wes called my phone the other night asking for Frank's number YOU TOO? cause apparenlty maria had told him frank wanted to talk to him? this is so fucking pathetic pathetic god damnit he told me DAN told him he wanted to talk waste of time worthless sons of bitches yeah too much way too much feely feely bullshit get over yourselves Ha all of you fuck seriously "i'm hurt... i have problems... the unbelievable love" SMACK heh "you know me burc, i don't have drama""... yeah, only for the last..... since i knew you... .SMACK" HA "i want to talk to wes, i need to tell him things about him and maria, cause i know how to relate to everyone and impart helpful wisdom, which i am overflowing with"" ..........SMACK" LOL "i mean... can't we just take ourselves a little less seriously, do some shots of jack and smoke a joint" christ almighty i think that's what tonight is about hopefully i really don't want to hear a word of it and i'm going to get nasty if i do yeah well is wes going to be there?

cingular has roll-over minutes as weel $60.00 is 1000 minutes vs 850 on cingular 5000 minutes is 130 vs 250 Cingular doesn't have 3G yet either and they haven't even started building you can get 1000 min on cingular for $60 where do you see this? you'd have to do a regional plan oh nah "i mean,,, how often do you leave the northeast" more than twice a year is enough wait.... ahh... and did you see tmobile has free fridays now? http://www.weather.com/maps/maptype/currentweatherusnational/index_large.html?from=weathercenter bullshit oh yeah? yeah even better 3 day weekends that's only with a specific plan tho it's not bad tho $40 for 600 minutes plus free weekend s that's a pretty good deal ahh yeah only problem is check it 39.99 for national with 600 min and unlimited night and weekends "the ""Get More"" plan" lol that's $10 cheaper than cingular they do a shitty job of advertising that one but no rollover right and no mobile to mobile and no IN calling yeah i have to go with cingular me too suz is going to be in colorado mobile to mobile is key are you SURE you get mobile to mobile outside your region?

Nokia links to them from their site... can't be that bad so... anyway.. we'll see she said they were expecting the phones yesterday oh yeah i'd wait it's a decent phone from what i can tell.. the v220 was cheap v180 felt better nokia was sorta flimsy on the keys i went to cingular to test them out day before yesterday i think the only thing missing on the v551 as compared to the nokia is mp3 and FM capability and bluetooth no v551 has bluetooth oh sorry i read it the other way so anyway.... we'll see how it goes thanks for you input np phones are fucking expensive these days very the hot shit is.... "through lets talk, i only had to sign up for a year of cingular" and the final phone price is $29.99 "through cingular,,, it would have been 2 years and final phone price of $99.99" i want to know what the catch is can you get insurance on the phone? "not completely sure, but don't see why not" my understanding is that you can insure basically any phone and who administeres your cingular account? cingular so you can add other services later? sure... all you have to do to recieve the mail in $50 rebate is send letstalk a copy of your second bill "so, after the second month... you could do whatever you want to the account" ok let me ask you something k the assistant of the loan officer that i'm working with at Commerce is a real fucking bitch they lost my paperwork over a week and a half ago damn and every time i try to get information out of her or get her to do something she feeds me this ration of bullshit instead of being helpful i've been trying to be nice to the loan officer even though she isn't the one that makes the decision because she's the one that supposed to be on my team but they definitely aren't acting like they're on my team and every time i call i get pissed off wondering how much leeway i should give this girl in terms of? how much shit i should eat getting the fucking thing processed last night at 4:45 "Anne tells me that she's lost my paperwork and that if i fax it to her by 5:30 she'll get it over to the department that processes it " "first thing in the morning" so i can have an answer this afternoon "at 5:15, after I've faxed some bullshit copy i had with a bunch of scratched out numbers" I call and get her assistant Michelle "who says that ""a lot of papers come through this office" and when i MAKE her go pull it off the fax machine and put it on Anne's desk "Michelle says that ""Anne will review it in the morning and blah blah" "Now," I just called over to their office and get Michelle who says Anne isn't even IN yet and that she doesn't know when she'll be in that she's assured me that my papers are on her desk how much are you applying for? but hasn't volunteered to help me in any fucking way "18,000" in getting the stupid papers faxed over she's really pissing me off because she acts like i'm the problem sounds like both of these people are worthless anyone above them? i don't know but i do know that if they don't get this done today i'm going to find out yeah write all this shit down make calls find out who you need to send this stuff to even though i still need the loan? i mean like... a lettter of disgust when i first started with this she was like Oh Sure send your paperwork in by 3 and we can have an answer for you by the next day and if you're approved why don't you apply elsewhere? we can finish your paperwork in a week try another branch or bank because every other time i've dealt with commerce they've been super awesome i got my ATM card back from them yesterday in like 15 minutes plus both me and my dad bank there yeah put that in the letter can you deal with another loan officer ? i'm wondering who to ask i may go by my branch today and ask definitely just do that where is this branch you are dealing with? Anne is in the corporate office over on Market Street which makes me wonder if there is a different one i got her name from a friend of mine who is the branch manager of Society Hill "so, this anne character is the end all be all of loans?" i don't get the advantage of dealing with her she might be the only one that i had was that she was a contact of Bobbys but they're really fucking up on me and i really think Michelle is being rude "well, ask your friend" see what kind of information you can get about the process and if you could/should go to another branch "I mean, it's really stupid of them to screw you around like this" i'll wait and see what happens today for real it is btw... i didn't really like the razr in person i do yeah? where did you check it out? cingular nice i really like the fact that it's thin yeah in a year they will have better in a year i won't need a phone ? i neeed a phone now right i'm just sayig $30 versus $400 is huge nah not over the course of a year and in a year... i'll drop $400 on a phone that is worth it $400 will get me to colorado and back 1.5 times what's going to be different in a year? improved everything camera resolution less wide that's a false argument larger exterior screen that's like saying i'm going to wait to buy my powerbook in a year and waiting for three years i did that with the ipod and you know what? they came out with what i wanted after four years i need a phone now right... and you could have bought a mp3 player for $50 in the meantime nope that's worthless not at all spending an extra 50 on a poor user experience haha well i need the functionality of a phone now the v551 serves that purpose you're buying a PC all over again you won't get a new phone in a year and you know it dude think about it i have $30 attachment to this phone you think i give a shit about $30 over the course of 12 months? i don't give a shit about $30 over the course of this afternoon "clearly, in a year, if they make the razr better" i'll be all over it right now i don't value 1 dimension that much .35 inches of depth is not worth $370 to me it is to me werd are you going to insure your phone? yes now your phone jumps to 460 yup and i'm going to have it for three years and not worry about it again i wonder if you can get a small bluetooth headset for it 3rd party the ones the show on motorola's website are huge i've read reviews on third party some work some don't yeah that was the think about the nokia they use a standard profile they have a really nice headset for the 6230 what have you got going on Sunday ? dunno why "Maria, Joey, Andy and I are going to my grandmothers house to have dinner for my birthday" you want to come? when is your birthday? tuesday possibly i'll tell you later tonight? sure which nokia headset? i don't think there is much going on..... have to check with suzanne trying to find now "http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,47867,00.html" Ooooo i like right? yes MUCH better than anything else i've seen that's the first one that i've seen that i like all the shit you can do from teh headset $120 yeah so $210 total if i got the phone to go with it actually maybe it would work with lesser models who is this?

Bush not the time for me to discuss trying to get a doctor when you're poor is like trying to win the lottery yeah true or going to atlantic city spend a thousand dollars on the high likelyhood of nothing right "anyway, there's nothing really to do about it" he's rearranging his room "fluids, cool baths... vitamins" just make it so body can do it's thing "yeah, i think i'm going to have to break it to him that london broil isn't going to be really appealing with tonsils the size of texas" haha let's think soup don't want to waste body energy digesting a cow on another note... this letstalk.com place is pretty amazing "everything has gone really smoothly, knock on wood" i'll probably use it if i can scare up the money i'm just bein a child waiting for santa claus don't mind me ha monday then yes sir i'll have to come show sup YES! someone to talk to oh how i've been starving to type "(yes, i am hungover.... madly)" what's up with you? just got home what you do last night? julian's place just the two of you? no he had a little holiday get together packed cause his place is so small and all of a sudden my battery is dead for no particular reason that's lame maybe the stupid fucking aluminum case sucked the life out of it still bent are you? quite it's a clever design flaw i want a sausage egg n cheese on croysant they know what you did to your machine i'm eating a leftover buffalo chicken cheese steak bastard i only have food that is good for me here blows you're also a five minute walk from gastronomic bliss ? guide me portobello road grease for miles around (south st) that was an obscure cultural reference to Bedknobs and Broomsticks yeah.... i've moved on ;) how to fill my morning then? you bored? i can't remember the last time i had a shower shower then funkmaster how's andy we went to the emergency room last night they gave him a shot in the ass of antibiotics and a take home goodie bag with percocets nice hehe is he feeling any better? what did they say? they said it looked like a bomb went off in the back of his throat he can swallow again so that's something honestly i feel like i've witnessed a terrorist attack and really feel numb to the whole thing gotcha i wonder if i should just get another virgin mobile phone prob not sunk costs right you know my feeling on the subject get the best phone for the cheapest "don't think i'll pass the credit check for cingular, which means some god awful deposit" you know what what you can just put it through on the letstalk.com website somehow i passed the credit check "which, MAYbe my recent efforts to fix my credit are actually paying off" but i was still surprised which plan did you choose? 39.99 national so. 450 anytime rollover minutes 5000 night and weekend free mobile to mobile the thing is.... you pay for text messaging "which, i'm not so so worried about..." but fyi do you know how many minutes you were using before like 300 a month of my anytime and maybe 1000 of night and weekend???? maybe hmmm i have no idea how much i use what a fucking great idea that was getting people to try to figure out how much they use the phone in order to pay for it you're too low you're fucked too high fucked way too low way too fucked eh i just pay my $40 and call it even maria had an $800 phone bill well one does have to be reasonable wasn't that cause of dropped calls? yes i still don't get it tho if you know you are having a problem you should probably monitor its effects i don't think anybody can reasonably expect an $800 phone bill that's extortion sure... i'm just saying there had to be signs have you ever heard of anything else where you pay for a service and then pay 20 times more because that service is broken? i don't know the details of the situation no i have not but there has to be something to it any carrier i have ever been with has always removed dropped calls and what i'm saying is.... to rack up $800 that has to be a lot of dropped calls yup so one had ample warning the problem didn't surface from nowhere well they stuck it to her yes sounds like it "anyway, i don' t know which plan i should get" what details are you contemplating? nationwide/regional? nationwide are you contemplating more minutes than the $40? probably i thought the 850 plan might work might be way too much too and you are thinking of the nationwide to cover your trips to TN? i just hate the idea of roaming "right,,, but you can look at the map and determine if you actually need nationwide" how much does it save you?\ $40 would get you 600 min and unlimited nights/weekends no rollover yes rollover wait still 5000 night and weekend shit nevermind and $9.99 for mobile to mobile screw that yeah might as well do the $50 and get the 600 anytime if that is what you want how much do you use your phone?

"yeah, mapquest when i'm on the road" ah http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/003871.php pretty neat so i think i'm going to have to find a different loan officer at commerce bank i'd say so "would you a) write a nasty letter to the original, useless loan officer and copy customer service OR b) not write a nasty letter to the original, useless loan officer and copy customer service" i'd not write a letter that's not going to get you a loan "but i *would* use the ""oh so terrible experience and poor customer service"" when talking to your next loan officer" i think that's the only way you can use it to your advantage how to find? i'm thinking i have to call customer service to get a new name prob call them anywy they are there to help you you want money you have a legitimate gripe they are there for both would it be a personal or business loan? are you going to incorporate? should i? yes i'm thinking that should be your first step before the loan well you can't get a business loan if you have no business we're using the numbers from my father's business ah and his federal tax id "ok, so the loan is under his business" pretty much do you know you can apply for this online? you use commerce right? yes for a business loan though? https://secure.commerceonline.com/forms/bank/smallBusiness_loanApp.cfm interesting never underestimate the internets my boy this has more on it than the paper one? the paper one doesn't have credit references hmmm http://bank.commerceonline.com/business_banking/loans_creditlines.cfm i think i'm going to use it call roger "or Mike, Gregg, Kevin, or Jim" err...

"basically I have two options 1. buy applecare for $47, extending the warranty for another year... and covering any shipping costs/etc. 2. buying my own battery and replacing it myself for $30 + shipping" applecare why didn't you get it in th efirst place? wasn't offered it and does applecare cover the battery? it does... but they only replace if it has degraded more than 50% has it? borderline no shit? i havn't given it the true test "which is to let it play continuously until it runs out.... no fast forward, no nothing" oh this is your iPod yeah sorry for the confusion np you still think the $47 is worth it? i thought it was like 100 to replace don't they have a battery replacement program and number 2 you haven't had yours that long hav eyou? i mean less than a year 10 mo. which means your warranty should still be good which is why i can still purchase the applecare however "after 6 months, you have to pay for shipping" $30!!!!!!!!!!! to ship? right nuts buy applecare free shipping and if you've had it for 10 months then what happens in another 10 months? right i think you're right plus they don't replace the battery they send you a new one with your old engraved back slapped on it well... refurbed ah weird where can i find a damned jeweller there is a metal specialist on south street the people there are really nice.. but prob overpriced what is a metal specialist? well they have a lot of metal jewelry so that's what i call them where at? across from the TLA if that's the name of the place i'm thinking of there's no TLA on South ok what's the name of the place they have concerts on south street next to copa oh wait i think that is the TLA i was thinking the video store buahahhahh bastard bieeetch ok i'll walk down there i want to wear it tonight don't pay too much where are you going tonight $5 that was my next question and.ee's roommates are coming home from africa nice http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/news/121104_local_videogame.html ahhaha YES!!!!!! video games can save your life sending that to Maria is prob a bad idea i think i just ate some bad cheese lol yeah don't stir that hornets nest Wes has decided to rear his ugly head again are you serious about what? totally unprovoked he tried to get some of our friends mad at us so they came and asked us about it and I got mad enough when I heard about it that I sent him this: "Wes, I had lost the respect that I had for you some time ago, but we're now at a point that I want you to remove yourself from my circle. �Do not talk about me to other people. �Do not tell other people how I may or may not feel because you definitely don't have the ability to speak with my voice. �Do not involve me in your pathetic life. �Do not contact me again. - Mikee" so then he responds to *Maria* and basically tries to push all of her buttons at once he's delusional and trying very hard to get us all to descend into his hell what a whiney little girl he's so pathetic he' he's a web-baby crying on the internet ha yeah he knows what he's doing Maria says she's getting a restraining order if he doesn't keep away he's really gone off it "my advice to him is ""eat a twinkie fatty" HA HAHAHAAAA burc that's so perfect so anyway she's all vulnerable chit i guess it's my fault this kid needs a beat down no.. it is his yeah we all knew he wouldn't stop it is dude i was just happy not hearing baout it on a daily basis right life is all nice again this really has to be it though he sent me a message and i just deleted it without reading ok i'm going down south st bbl "however, why maria and joey chose to be so outward about their relationship on that stupid fucking forumn is beyond me" alright quick questin i don't even read that shit anymore ? do you think i woul dget better service from an apple store ie the one in NYC why New York? if i just walked up to them and said this thing sucks ass or KOP possibly yes nyc i was thinking cause aren't you all going up there this weekend?

(818) 282-6767 thanks gotta see if i can waste some time tonight studying? yeah and things just wouldn't be right if i got a jump on the family website ha have you played Myst yet? i couldn't figure out what to do after i lined up the wavelengths "you think i can pump the audio from my cable box, to my laptop, to my bluetooth?" "sure, why not" yo sure why not what? "7:36 PM you think i can pump the audio from my cable box, to my laptop, to my bluetooth?" i couldn't figure out how to route the sound once i got it in from the tv like. i could see it in system preferences line-in the meter was moving but i couldn't figure out a program to put it through to even the headphones or built-in speakers you have to open up the Audio MIDI utility and check a little box to get it to playthrough much less the headset i thought i messed with that too audio midi huh? under utilities? yes yes maybe i'll try again I think i'm gonna return the headset anyhoo y? i dunno one of the calls i made the lady said she had a hard time hearing me others were fine and it's a $95 piece suzanne was talking about not getting internet at her place in colorado this morning "but i think he she realizes the benefits, considering the iSight, she will" ha i hope that's pretty funny yeah... for you it is for me it's a potential $260 waste how was last night with andy's roomates?? i saw them for maybe 5 minutes what's up with that? sex man figures you think suzanne will change her mind given iSights? here i was with this awesome idea... now i'm stuck give her the iSight not having internet is ridiculous for someone who is supposed to be in school she's not going to be in school.... gonna be workin and studying for mcats but whatever she can get her dad to pay for it she's too damn stubborn for her own good have any hints for making an animated ribbon? fing one? find yeah been lookin "EA has signed a 5-year agreement with the NFL that gives them exclusive rights to use NFL players, teams, and stadiums in their products." ha that's nutty "According to an e-mail sent today to Harvard students, Google will collaborate with Harvard's libraries on a pilot project to digitize a substantial number of the 15 million volumes held in the University's extensive library system, which is second only to the Library of Congress in the number of volumes it contains. Google will provide online access to the full text of those works that are in the public domain." saw that god save the internets fur serious i need to learn how to shut up lol wes? maria? andy hhahahah what happened? somehow our discussion of group sex turned into a disagreement about instinctual sex which then devolved into a conversation about the utility of religion and unfortunately when you get me going i take no prisoners i should have just shut up yep learned that the hard way multiple times maria and i are suggesting that he may not be on my level and ultimately i'll have to give him up and that just sucks absolutely not what i had in mind when i started the argument and i started it fuck me dude better to figure out now believe me Burciago we're talking about small differencesz that add up to much i mean explain he's so fucking close mikee i dunno you are in a diff situation eh maybe not i dunno eh me neither i hope he doesn't leave me fuck that i'm not gonna give you that give me what "the ""it's way harder to find a good gay guy than it is a good straight girl" ha it is eh maybe not when you're operating where i am it's just difficult no matter what i should be a priest and celibate exactly picky picky PICKY i suffer from the same NEVER SATISFIED i really don't want to be condescending to him and i think it might be unavoidable w/e this is not something i'm going to stress myself out about at least we're aware of it yeah it's something you have to figure out within yourself i think i might have fucked him up though how explain he's committed to being a christian "and i told him that while it's a useful framework in the mundane world, it's something that i believe he'll have to give up to understand it" yeah that's tough man "yeah, i shouldn't have fucked with something that personal to him" sure at the same time do you want to be with someone where you can never touch that or agree with it "not really, which i guess is why i didn't stop shaking the tree" yeah "i mean,, ultimately, sure,, maybe you should have approached it with more caution" but you were going to get to the same place one way or another and now that you are at this crossroads you just have to decide for yourself if you are willing to be with that person it's not my decision to make it's his sure i respect his choice i dunno if he can respect mine right ok so you have decided that you can deal with this sure that you don't and won't have a problem with his choice immediately it was fun his mindset right i don't i went to his church on sunday alrighty then yeah... you are waiting for him to decide pretty much it really sux tho a lot the whole having to bite your tongue deal and shut up most of the time possible but not alone in bed in the dark "and accept that a person doesn't believe the same, etc etc" yeah well that works for a while but then you start to second guess "that's why i said ""this person"" earlier" ? because... you have to step aside from ANDY if you think about it in terms of ANDY then you are going to get all warm inside and be willing to sacrifice anything know what i mean? yeah seriously not my problem though it's his did you apologize? hells no aight i will not anybody who chooses to be with me is going to have to be able to spar a little and i've let it go this far without turning my head against him yeah but it had to happen one way or the other and it was really a non-confrontational way of doing it shit man... i have no idea i mean honestly.. i could change things about suzanne and i'm so damn picky but at this point... i've given up certain things i just don't know compromise is the only way two people can stay together yeah it blows hA because compromise leaves you wanting that's a good thing though because if you were satisfied what then? then i could walk around being completely happy with that part of my life no questions no reason to look at anything else "nah, it would drive you nuts" eh whatever roxana's sister was really hot ha HA ;) :-( probably a nutcase tho i bet she's fun tons a fun nutcase yep had a great time i don't know what either of us was thinking she has a bf etc etc not like we did anything but if either of our bf/gf would have seen us it would not have been pleasant w/e right i'm over it every day you choose to be with Suzanne exactly and she's great not exclusive of other considerations yeah TRUE and you know what.... she is the best thing for me now "More recent memorabilia on offer includes the rhinestone-studded tracksuit and knuckle-duster ring worn by Sacha Baron Cohen's TV character," http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4094299.stm christmas present for Gonzo?

SEPTA tried to scare the shit out of people byh telling everyone they're going out of business just to get decent legislation passed it's NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN ok so what do i lose? nothing people in this town would shit themselves no wrong you lose the opportunity cost of spending that money now instead of over the course of the next year haha i wasn't going to spend it anywya i call bullshit alright i'm not really worried about it i don't have a better use for $260 second bullshit dude... ? "i have $8,000 in the bank" i don't think $260 is of concern not YESTERDAY you were freaking out about buying a $100 headset esp when i know i'll use them sure i'm a mizer i know how to save money and i know that the interest on $260 or even $500 is nothing so i think it's worth the chance that the fare will go up and i'll save $60-$150 you could have spent that money on bartending school and made 100 times that i don't have the time to do that and you are a fool if you think bartending school is the way to go ha even if you want to be a bartender y is that? i can't count on our collective hands and feet the number of bartdenders have told me it's bullshit those that have and have not done it alike "it might very well be bullshit, but does it not make it easier to find your first bartending job?" do i want a bartending job "no, but i d" and what does that have to do with me illustrates one of many possible alternative investments alright.. what's the guarantee write it up i'll throw you some money.. you tell me how much i'm going to make doing it the beauty of this is.......... i KNOW i am going to use this you could have bought mushrooms i have to sell them i have to expose myself to the dangers of doing so you might have to sell your tokens no I won't why would i? you think septa is going to stop running? no you said so yourself even they haven't proposed that are you going to ride the subway 400 times in the next year? probably third bullshit i guarantee 200 in fact you obviously don't know either 1. how to count or 2. how much i ride the subway you'll be tempted to ride it more often no i will not because you'll have so many otkens because i know that it is cheaper to ride my bike then WHY THE HELL DID YOU BUY TOKENS?

"like... "" well, you must not need it that bad... you didn't even take your loans in the spring" eh i don't know about that you could argue that you need it more since you didn't take a loan well but then they'd say... we'll give you more loan now becasue you didn't take those loans then "basically, i got the director to hook up my penn grant up by an additional $2K" this semester and he justified it on the system as because i was goign to have to take more loans later so take it? remind me the diff between subsidized and unsubsidized govt pays interest on sub interest accrues starting now on unsub take one the subsidized pay the other i mena mean i really don't see much of a difference if you've got the money now esp since i'm gonna be done in 5 months i would almost say go ahead and pay it sure the difference is that when they go to give me loan or grant for this summer i'm thinking i am more likely to get higher grant amounts if they see that i'm more extended in terms of loans than if i opted not to take loans in spring semester know what i mean? how are you going to hide the cash you have on hand? haha that's not a problem ok take the loan yeah.. fuck it and then pay them off after they grant your summer loans i'm gonna take both exactly wanna go shopping? ;) ha i wish in italy maybe you wanna buy a ticket? negative no time me neither how is suzanne?> great miss her so much she left yesterday at 5 oh shit not long yeah just a couple days fri-sun i just emailed to take both loans yipeee what you up to? have you heard of fantom drives? no ? just screwing aroundon my pb http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-191-011&depa=0 cheap seriously why do you need?

"he came from a cucumber farm, three hours west of boston" he wasn't exactly my idea of a redneck "you gots to see it, back where it all began." BELIEVE ME. you've been there? yeah. "i watched two horses fuck, then kick the shit out of each other while his dad, who weighs 600 lbs chased a baby racoon around with a loaded shotgun." whoa it's a good time though sure i just had no idea this was part of his personality oh yeah. keeps that one under the cover of ivy league sophistication and a british wifey right and a ski lift HA! his own personal snow making god forbid he should ever figure out how what are you up to? trying to figure out a good way to toot my own horn on my resume. a profile/objective/summary to start the fucker off. "something i can add and remove a sentence or two, depending on what job is in question" at Wharton they told us Objectives are pointless "i think so too, but, it's not just an objective." "more of a profile, with a one sentence objectivish ending" international playboy seeking roguish employment "trying to incorporate ""social lubricant" asshat go work for your brother i hate this shit. yeah looking for a job blows goats "yeah, i could. $176/week blows bigger goats" so does applying for a business loan i need a $50k + job in the philly area gonzo does too then we can buy a block of apts. downtown and market them to spoiled penn dbags for LOTS of money then do it again and again i just read a blurb on /. that says that 50% of all IT jobs in the US are going the way of the dodo yeah. pretty much dude i always used to say that a monkey could do my job. "i'm in a house on 48th and Hazel right now, that's like two blocks off Baltimore" someone took it literally and is making indians do it instead "houses in this neighborhood sold for 80,000 about five years ago" same houses now selling for half million yup. university expansion will do that. that and scaring away the black ppl they go hand in hand it's actually really nice down here the houses are beautiful "black go south, property values go north" even for a half a mil split it into apartments.... oh there are whole buildings for sale down by rittenhouse i covet them "for what i was paying in rent, i could have got a $350K mortgage" that's nucking futs it's the source of my cynicism "not, of course, your overpriced and undervalued university degree" don't mention that while i'm looking for a job right now. we should have stolen that sceptre still can auction the fucker "for oh, say, 150K" back to the school "EBAY, just to taunt them." they'd never get it back LOL perfect i wouldn't let it happen. "to never have to see the president nancing around in that fucking gown, with that chain, and that thing" bastards all of them if i get that fucking loan i can pay them off and repress the whole experience i get a call per day from AES. it's a constant reminder. andy gets them every 15 minutes from Sallie Mae "they should just text me....""IT WASN'T WORTH IT" SALLIE MAE! ARGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! that's the government you know i couldn't care less at this point. "when i can afford it, moving to sweden" i think i might move to London within five years SOOOO essspensive yeah fun tho good schools "and, you'd probably get paid in pounds." not like the dollar is going to do anything for me "County health officials are having trouble finding a TV station willing to air a public service announcement about syphilis that employs a lumpy, red cartoon character named ""Phil the Sore." "well, if i had been getting paid in pounds for the last three years, ..................that's fucking awesome" second paragraph "Los Angeles-area broadcasters said the ad is in poor taste, but the county health agency said it is simply trying to reach gay men - the group at greatest risk of getting the sexually transmitted disease, which has been on the rise in recent years." http://www.sacbee.com/24hour/weird/story/1887154p-9818057c.html what's in poor taste? "the ad itself, who it is targeting, or what? were they going to air it during sesame street?\" i think they're referring to the idea of making a cartoon out of a pustule i wonder if he drips "well, they should show photos." that's nasty oh sure never you mind janet jackson's titty here's some photos of syphallis "photos, with a caption : DON'T BE FUCKIN' WITHOUT A COCK HAT." LOL bitches it would be the most effective campaign ever that might make the fcc spontaneously combust. better than the this is your brain on drugs eggs this is your brain on drugs: girl on toilet sameer's apt. ew fear and loathing ever see band of brothers one or two episodes very very good andy says hi hi andy feel better how's the perc? feelin............perky?

"now, it's different." "plus, they didn't even have an army this time around" nothing to challenge our air force. fish in a barrel "true, and yet somehow it still sucks ass" WWII was totally different you're right part of the reason i want to do the germany thing to go be a Nazi? "that, and the place got flattened." all new stuff even a new Reichstag brand spankin' shiny new everything. fucking cheap plastic shit maybe. buildings that look like amoebas i trust the germans and their engineering prowess to make nice shit. amoebas are sweet. ha well then have i got a building for you must find it again Sean McBroom went to the University of Alabama where it so happens that DaimlerChrysler has some sort of plant got recruited worked for 5 years or so now works for UBS still in germany living like a fat hog partied his nuts off in college with a 4.0 because everyone was so fucking stupid paid for by the school i wish i had done that. at umass i want my damned money back ALL OF IT. bitches it can't be true that it isn't going to do anything for us. it just can't be. "i'm going to lose it if this job search thing becomes protracted and hopeless, and i have an ivy league degree." you won't lose "you'd think that such a thing alone, would warrant some interest in them talking to you." it's different that it used to be just to see if you're in idiot. the internet was maybe the worst thing that ever happened to HR what's different? besides HMOs "no, hr is the worst thing to happen to hr. stupid fucks." Ha nah they have geometrically more information to process now than they did before people anywhere could know about any job opening there's too much data for anyone to filter so none of it gets processed at all and it all happens through back channels i'd say there's less of a shot these days and that's a paradox yeah. i'm getting on the phone on monday to start finding these back channels. if you're coming off the street good idea and don't forget you can always go back to school "fuck the ""resumes@gofuckyourself.com"" route." yeah that's a dead end IMO NO way i'm ever paying to go back to school. it's got to be on someone else. unless you meant go back for career assistance. nope study get a PhD HAHAHA!!!! get hired by the university career idiot ok i'm out for now check you later word. asshat it's my birthday HAPPY BIRTHDAY! thanks :) feel older? refined HAHAH! and sore from work? old age or have you been hitting the gym? now that's pretty funny i know i made my computer look like it's running OS X pretty rad skin? skinned the bag out of it "then, downloaded objectdock" which is a pc version of the dock complete with dock impressive you're the perfect person to ask wish i could figure out how to make a screen shot alt print scren paste into photoshop hmmm... "i didn't like the object bar which i downloaded, so i kept a windows style toolbar at the bottom, put the dock at the top, loaded a sweet skin, voila" it even makes photoshop act in the floating window manner as it does in os x no shit alt printscreen didn't do shit "well dam,mit" i'll have to look into this. jeffrey yes what to do about a blood blister the size of a dime on the tip of my index finger bust that shit use a lighter and a pin or a knife or whatever remove the skin? NO! drain it don't pop it either hole will be too big and it will rip wtf without letting the underskin heal how about exacto knife? think of the dead skin as a band-aid that'll work typing with my middle fucking finger "can't hurt that much, or, maybe it can" neosporin? is it a blood blister from an impact or just general chaffing? yeah that's good stuff hurts whjen i press iy pinched iy with a jigsaw sucks. drain it. won't hurt as much put some ice on it too ugghhh. need more ram y thing is choking right now. buy a mac "have 3 firefox windows open, just opened photoshop, running AIM, excel, itunes and it's CHOKING right now" buy a g5 time for CVS a great place for all home surgery needs "got the screen shot thing to work. going to email you a clip, along with a copy of my resume, for layout advice/critique." you see those PS3 screenshots? cool YEAH BTW WTF dunno. "those could have been cutaways from gameplay, but still, what if they weren't....." i think they weren't i HOPE they weren' t does not bode well for the future of time management in my life LOL i mean i think they were here's why the leaves in the trees motivation for a high paying job and an HD projector i want the VR version VR? Virtual Reality brb brb ? be right back i'm gettin the lingo how do you drain it without popping it? two holes on opposite sides press sloowwwwwwwly ..once the holes are in it. you're a genius let it dry out and then put a little neosporin around the holes. no band aid until you have to work with tools again. k it's not going in the second side make it might not need the second hole if it drained out already check out the headlining story on engadget.com my new fav site do i have to get it all out of my finger not a necessity i should just leak out though it. it should just leak out. not i that didn't sound healthy "I, I have to press on it so it leaks out" if it works. just try not to tear the skin off it will hurt alot more where are you? back got most of it out covered in neo coolio you're not on your mac? am hmmm.... tried my pc mic from the ps2 said you were not compatible with the talk function of im\ heh? i wasn'? this was on the pc. aol im has a talk function may not work with ichat first of all did you sign off iChat? nope don't know if it matters let me switch to AIM see if it works back to ichat yes AIM sux brb goping to lay down otay "http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,47867,00.html" blood blister holiday today? all day thanks for the resume tweak. np just suggestions what's your take on the way these things should be presented? at what point doeswork experience become more important the educational background? wow. not awake yet ha eh on a resume if you turn the thing upside down it should be topheavy that works. what font did you use? Adobe Garamond i like the idea of the pdf attachment that was next on my list. thanks to the acrobat pro you gave me one of illustrator's native formats is PDF so i just built it there word is a terrible layout program no shit that took me two days to format yeah pain in the ass took a couple hours to redo have not worked with illustrator too much yet though. now's your chance "yeah, seeing as i'm so busy these days...." heh i think i'm going to march up to the front door of the market research/consulting firm i want to work at and force feed them a copy. today looks as good as any "fuckers haven't emailed me back yet, though i sent them a garbage draft" dude black hole yeah. sucks ass "though, i've received several calls from recruiting agencies based on what i posted on monster.com on monday" they aren't a bad option for getting into mega companies "start as a temp, if they likey, full time is your reward." sounds a bit slavish to me though. dude nepotism sounds easier Ha thing is the temp to full is for real a lot of the time you can get fucked but if you're good it can work out relaly well it's like the new interview process it's how most large companies do things these days basically have outsourced the interview process "have the service people screen the potential employees," give them a couple of months as a test plug them in or toss them out after that standard practice now not a bad thing to consider "yeah, but my fucking health insurance through cobra is $358/month" you still have it? yeah. but it's being paid with borrowed money now. it done cleaned my clock seriously folks insisted on it. that' slike a house payment no shit everything is like a house payment nowadays just don't have the house to show for it yet soon though soon heh i feel a shit coming on brb lol i'm calling bullshit on the flash based iPod how about the ibm takeover rumor? "bullshit too, they just got out of the desktop market" on the cheap OS X on ibm servers... you can do that anyway at least i think you should be able to "perhaps, but to have all of their stuff shipped with OS X" and get the rest of apple's stuff they could afford it sure the culture probably wouldn't mix very well perhaps apple phones? PDAs? both developed and never released for what turns out to be very smart thinking PDAs are dead i think they're stupid Phones are a commodity who the fuck has that much going on that they can't remember it on their own apple would have a shot in that market but not like the iPod "if you've got that much going on, get a secretary" that's why we have assistants the phone thing could be possible someone was claiming that phone based mp3 players could be the most serious competitior to the ipod in the future "and that's all fine and whatnot, but i want a ps3 NOW" http://engadget.com/entry/1234000113023000/ Apple experimented with WiFi iPods over three years ago they should take another look wifi is spreading like a rash the shit really works now i'd say the record companies nixed it 2-4 years away from being reintroduced "i was thinking about the possiblity of a wifi based, radio reciever." a streaming internet walkman so to speak fuck satellite radio fuck regular radio i want free shit with no commercials what's the diff? between what and what? sattelite and regular sattelite has no commercials right xm or sirius commercial free subscriber based something like 10 bucks a month plus cost of reciever in a city like philly soon to have wifi for all "why not build a walkman to tune into the streaming web radio stations that do the same thing as the satellite fuck faces, without the satellite and subscription part?" conceivably a PDA would do that yup or an iPod i though you said the wifi enabled ipod wasn't out yet it's not neither is city wide wifi right hotspots are everywhere though can 't drive down my street without finding a signal too annoying to walk down the street and lose the signal plus bandwidth would be incredible true. "however, the signal point i made was just an illustration that this shit is taking off like wild fire" a bunch of older morons like my parents are now able to figure it out just a matter of time how do your parents like it? can't live without it now. six months into the grand experiment they couldn "'t figure out how to fix any sort of problem, but..." with time it should work itself out "basically, i want to make the wifi walkman my patented idea." do it patents cost $100 to file i think get someone like sameer to shit out some r&d money and make it happen bury clear channel the fucks who ruined today's radio "my mp3 collection is respectable, but after working where it did, for as long as i did, doing what i did, i have come to realize how quickly you can get sick of 4000 songs" i'll bet someone has beaten me to the punch ha i know what you mean! probably 5 years ago or something and are going to make a killing It's a Sony what's a sony? did the japs take my idea? that's what the slogan was when the walkman came out "what, ""we're japs and we took your idea, make better.. FUCKYOU WHITEY" sounds like Microsoft it's a great business model you know what's a better business model? selling dope "the price per ounce of gold just recently eclipsed the max i paid for a zip, four years ago." and that's just with the green stuff ha that too discount retail every major fortune for the past 200 years has been in discount retail fucking Waltons are richer than God 20.8 billion a piece and there are five of them yup. assholes i was just typing that. "i see, your typing skills are better than mine." even with a gimp finger how'd that work out? what happened with andy? Andy is currently laid out in my bed upstairs. He gets up for maybe 45 minutes and then starts feeling like shit again.

"anyways, fotis' dad is possibly starting a big to pretty big telecom venture in europe/s.america/Everywhere" i talked to him for 2.5 hours tonight. "i'll need to get more info from his dad, but it sounds like they looking for some help" is he for real? very legit well funded? more than likely privately what kind of telecom? that's what i need to hear more about. got jared's explaination "it's something along the lines of a voip calling card business, mixed with an interoffice phone network, on a global scale" or something "long distance rates of fractions of cents per minutes, idea is to log billions of minutes etc..." database and web design work are immediate concerns. foreign language skills are major plus he asked me to pass the word along to you and gzo you speak german "i speak what, french?" gonzo speaks cubanm jared is taking intensive greek apparently his extended family and network of friends are fucking loaded and going to pony up the loot to get things going. "again, this could be sunshine being blown up my ass, but he sounded like it was serious" "his dad has been doing shit like this with satellites for his whole life, all over the world" hmmm "so, he knows what he's doing" yup "telecom is a commodity, but then again, voip is part of the convergence industry" lots of money to be made see where it goes i'd like to hear more about it me too jared is going to get his parents to invite me over for dinner in the next week or so is jared in Boston?

"i think i pissed some people off last time around, but, they liked me, um, as a person?" pissed off? "i was.....restless, and had more influence on some co-workers than i had previously thought." "at the end of it all, i was basically doing whatever i wanted to do, with no issues whatsoever, or so i thought, but, turns out the some 40something people were complaining that i was getting away with too much." fuckin babies. how did you find this out? i was told to start coming in earlier. "when i started there, we had no hours." "being one of the few left from the time (everyone else had quit), i was still in that sort of mindset, despite my pussy faced manager's attempts to bring some order" to the place. he was such a failure. "however, he offered any sort of reference i wanted." i didn't even ask. "but, being paranoid, i'm thinking he was doing so just so he could get back at me for making him look foolish on...two occaisions." i should probably just stop drinking coffee ha nap time "yeah, i'm off to file some papers at a courthouse for my dad, then off to drop more resumes, as this email crap is just not going to cut it." good deal see you laters www.decisionresources.com my new employer kickass. jeffrey si buenos dias you've seen the extent of my spanish. yar what you up to? trying to bake a damned cheesecak e i was *this* close to buying a Photo iPod today i'm waiting. for? for cooler things must go to brooks brothers before 5 happy christmas chief i want to ask you about your job but no time now market research for drugs? have i got that right? yup. bitch what are you doing? as in right now? for them\ new product development group. first project is called decision metrics should last 18 months.

"it's coonnected, but i can't hear you" brb having some serious network slowdown problems. i hate RCN. "going to reset some things, watch some football. will check back later." the rcn dbag says there is a slowdown in my area because everyone is sitting at home in front of their computers and tvs. i didn't think that was supposed to happen w/ cable connections. YO! Hey---it's Andy; Mikee's not here hi. couldn't figure out how to work the audio hi how's it going? good i guess you kicked our asses last sunday though i was too drunk to notice lol "yeah, me too." football.... sweet. no riots here though. right on "anyways, i'm leaving my office and was just going to say hi to mikee." i'll let him know nice one. have a good weekend. you too fucking the motherfucking snow argh skype? voip telephony bologna ah better sampling rates than audio chat programs. super clear pay service skype out lets you call phones around the world for price of local call let's call qatar and tell them to ship us some money ok. you speak...qatarian? english is the official language of money "heh, heh..." shifting to.......european. gotta learn to speak european. yeah on my list rosettastone.com/european "turns everything written in french into, ""Fuck you, Pig-dogs." yar you ever use PHP or javascript? i left my glass pipe back in jersey gonzo knows golive will write for you "i think dreamweaver does it as well, or at least has some sort of snippet library you can use." cut and paste just wondering what it's best used for. starting to run into it here and there. anything fancy that isn't flash even flash sometimes right. not that interested in fancy quite yet. jeffrey hola how goes it swell. you? "today, pretty good" nice. no post st. patty' hangover. me? my st pat's consisted of potato soup and corn bread at least you had the potato thing going. i didn't do anything. boston too much to handle for a country boy like you? basically. "whole city turns into mess of shitfaced idiots with green beer spilled all over themselves, looking to fight." fun fun i watched this thing on HBO about rich faggots and said to myself i know these people one of them something Weil reminds me of SO MANY people movie made by Jamie Johnson of Johnson & Johnson clan was it a good show? it was like a sophmore year final project that happened to be on HBO but facinating given the subject matter i don't have 'fancy cable' and have been relegated to watching bullshit syndicated crap like law and order: SVU on USA. dude $40 a month for digital cable + HBO + On Demand comcast? aye for one year we have RCN up here. SOOOOOOOOO bad. major cable internet issues. comcast just moved into the area. thinking switch switch it's fun service sucks but good deal "service, as in, when you call them to get something fixed, or, slow internet and crappy channel selection." internet connection is the only thing I care about. pixellated movies missing channels slow internet OH this you must see RCN just upgraded their service to include a 10 MB connection and fixed ip address for hosting etc. free for a year. shit don't work though. http://brawnyman.com/innocentescapes/ for some reason this reminds me of Bear hardcore can't check it here. bear is a douche. i talked to him a couple of weeks ago. you're at work? yeah aye. for some reason i've had him on the brain to call like burning in my head maybe i'll do "he just went to costa rica for two weeks. or, should i call it ""costa, dude." HAHAHAHAA his doucheatude factor is growing exponentially while living out there with the burning man rocket scientist clan. fancies himself to be a motorcycle collector now. DON't call him before i talk to you. you need to be prepared. i 'm warning you. dude how bad can it be i mean it's got to be worth a good laugh "yeah, it is." "BUT, you will feel disgusted at the same time." sounds pretty standard there's nothing standard about it. "actually uses the phrase, ""i'm out here, ya know, just playboyin' it up." "building rockets and lasers, cruisin on my bike." he wants to take a sabatical from his job to ride his bike to tierra del fuego. i though professors took sabaticals... he must be lonely he's dating a 21 year old french chick. the way he dropped that nugget on me almost made me punch him through the phone... "oh, dude, i'" m finally dating a french girl then said something about wishing had porked my old girl friend when he had the chance. :o ew ok so maybe we'll let bear sit tight for a while i'm not saying don't call him. dude it is WILDLY amusing. that's obnoxious he's said shit like that before. his head is so far up his ass it's unbelievable. maybe somebody should say something? meh sent you link by email you must checky http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/03/18/bobby.fischer.ap/index.html bobby fisher looks like an angry asshole i saw that. i think i'm going to look like that pretty soon. have you downloaded skype yet? for OS X it is? for all OS hm nope haven't tried just figured out what it was a couple weeks ago "i've talked with fotis in greece and had a test conference call at work with 2 people here, 1 in london and 1 in japan." it works VERY well. fotis is still in greece/ ? yeah. he does NOTHING. talking about business school in amsterdam or somethin. "like I said, doin' nothing." meh better than iChat/ ? "very much the same, except with this, you can buy minutes and call real phone numbers anywhere for 1.7 euro cent/minute. =~2 cents." ha Euros? it's the end of the world as we know it think the audio encoding might be better than most audio chat programs too. i'm using trillian. haven't tried that either i'm going to send you an audio chat to see if it works.. ? andy and i are trying to come up with some place to go out to eat ok hmm...philly...food. so many choices. Jeffrey Erickson did not respond criteria : sit down and have people bring me drinks doesn't matter what kind of food under $20 per that place we went was pretty good.... mar bar? marathon? yeah. yeah i like it you got no audio chat thing next to your name i don't think these guys have figured out the cross platform audio chat yet. hence my interest in skype... When they get SkypeIn to work i'll consider it "as in, phones calling computers??" yes hmm.... that sounds badass... "so, are you looking to get wasted and have munchies?" yar for under $20 total? twenty per person right. hmmm... you're going to have to pull some sort of pre-emptive alcohol strike. "then again, things are probably cheaper down there." i can't not spend $20 within the first 20 minutes of being anywhere up here. sux. we're talking about moving to new orleans HA! why? it's cheap and it's saucy and it's warm during the winter "true, true true." "AND, you can get a 64 ounce beer with a neck strap and giant straw from the pretzel on the corner." pretzel guy. think booze food truck see there? why not that's what i say ok i have to get ready word. back to excel and ppt. laters cheers. what the hell is this SMS thing the spammish email you got from me? yar uhh... it was a mistake. vic sent it to me i was clicking through the sign-up "and then, after telling the thing not to, it sent an email to EVERYONE i have ever been in contact with, directly or indirectly." naughty jeffrey "lots of people i don't even know, don't want to talk to, etc" 210 people woke up to that shit today. how in the bloody hell did it get your address book? i let it. "but unchecked all of the names, except for vic." program must have had an *error* oh man "yeah, i took to the time to un-check 209 boxes, all for naught." should be interesting to see what sort of responses it dredges up. jeffrey this thing has my private email now like super secret no one knows asshat you'll be fine. i feel like paris hilton now. i swear to christ if i get spam i'm forwading it to you that's fine. i love spam just bounce it. nada i've been doing that with voxel@neocyde and they don't do anything about it just deleted the account but i don't want to delete qubit "so, you already get spam...." no just one company to one email address no filters? my gmail filter is amazing. gmail filters i think i have four accounts in Mail.app "i don't know where mine is coming from, but i recently (three weeks ago) started getting some." "12 messages, all snagged by gmail." "legislation and gmail will bury the spammers, though, i've read that some of them make 750K/day." not a bad living "yeah, but that's the kind of excess that lands them in the news and in jail." i smell like ferrets LOL stinky bastards how did this happen? the house i was in today dude was a regional manager for Sally's beauty supply and borderline if you ask me like one of those dudes you want to keep calm "but totally calm, you know?" postal shit anyway he had ferrets in this shitty shitty house where the walls were made of 1/4 in plywood and shake when you cut them and his drain to his tub just poured out under the house perhaps he is growing a hat.... the connection to the street was gone ha HA yeah too much he probably has a hole the size of a volkswagen underneath his closet good place for bodies. why move to new orleans when you've got stuff like this in philly? "i'm sure there are ferrets and shanties in every city, but, not pat's" philly is cold that's about it fuck the cheesesteaks boston is cold.

"prof not able to meet w/ me often, people tell me i can giive out surveys then change mind" whoa i forgot if u did mktg research? "i think i took the labs, but i don't think i ever wrote the survey" my current concern is that i'm lookin at old books and nothing make sense! my survey is all written and i'm getttin a couple responses but if the prof isnt going to b super helpful ... this migiht b bad but if u dontt remember much of research or stat its ok hmmm try me "well, no specific questions yet" is this all that's left? i'm waiting to see if prof really is occupied by jury duty for the whole week and ??? beyond last thing for me to graduate ya lol Kim this is nutz who is the prof? americus reed has he been helpful up to now? miniimally maybe you need a new advisor no? "oh, not going to b able to find one at this point" i was rerjected by 6 people bfor he accepted me (cause i started it so late) ! ahhh what's the study about? diabetes education and pharma vs. dietary supplements as treatments it's an independent study? subtly trying to fiigurer out how to better promote the supplements.... iits actually and engin credit... senior applied project but indept study more or less "if you have specific questions, i might be able to get you in to see Barbara Kahn" that could b an idea ... i just feel like all the profs are so busy and bitchy w/ grading at this time would an extension help? technically all work should b done by fridaya... which is obviouslsy not happeneing... so its sorrta gonna gett done whenever it does i was shootting for the 14th... but now it might b even worse "yeah, if that's the case, then i'd let it slide until you can get better information" def don't let it stress you out thats near impossible ha i just want to b DONE oh believe me i understand that or have things all ready so twhen i have the data i can whip it out that's a good plan u did end up finishing everything right? i just had a meeting on friday to talk about a change of grade when that gets put through that's it whew right? "still, i'm making sure the damned thing gets done" it must it's taken like four meetings just to get him to write a post-it on doing it iidiots "actually, funny thing, he's been in court all semester" who? Martin Asher he's an expert witness for applied econ? "oh, gotcha" "k, well just let me know if you want me to call up the advising office" i just talked to tom ruth who says he'll be in town next week i hope we'll try to go out if you're interested for sure "ooh, also if u know any people w/ diiabetes could u pass along my survey?" yes my fam what email should i send it to? then u can distribute qubit@neocyde.net cool Kim! hey! how did you get a Gmail account?

Mikee Iyes yes I have to tell Tedi about Wes yes or just yes introduce do you really need to explain ? Honestly I want Tedi's advice wow but I don't know if that's fair I know that takes balls Tedi def has them member with TR? vaguely and I feel a little better knowing that he's hooking up with BOYS OH you weren't here then LOLOLOLOL last yeat I went and saw TR LOL "I know, but girls too apparently" and I tedi had to accept that I told him um i disagree tedi didn't have to accept that even though you told him to good that he DID accept that "but, if he does so at your will instead of his, then he marginalizes himself" becomes your proverbial bitch mikee yes\ i talked to wes tho about his guilt thing and ? I feel better I don't know if he does tho :P ha hee so you're going to make the effort ? nope first of all do you want to talk about this or are you tired of it? because we don't have to talk about it do you need to talk about it or are you ok with it? I want to write it out tell me and I can do both with you u sure? sure because I can just write it oh well so here goes after sex last night I said to wes your body turns me on and he immediately jumped up and put his underwear on ! so I didn't say anything whoa I know so then he goes to put this stupid movie on and I sat up and shut my powerbook slammed it shut and he stood there with his mouth open and I said NO NO deflections good and he said ok can we at least smoke a cigarette? "no problem I say, and start getting dressed" so then I said to him Wes you're never going to find what you're looking for if you don't have it yourself and he said "I'm just mental, I can't help it" ARGH "so I said, I'm surprised at you Wes" I thought you were smarter than that ! and walked downstairs leaving him in his underwear "(and of course, I looked gorgeous)" heh :P so he rushes down and sits on the step and sighs and I said what are you looking for? he said someone to finish my sentences for me and Misa does that and I said so you're lazy then? ha :D man what? I was zinging him yeah I had to I let him fuck me that's a big dea; l yes for me at leadt least :0 :F ttoof LOVE U TOOF i love you toof but then I knew were beating around the bush again and even tho wes CLAIMS he hates an elephant in the room I said Wes I am falling for you and I know you are falling for me but it's not my feelings are not your responsibility I mean my feelings aren't your responsibility just as you can't hold me responsible IF YOU WON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO FEEL YOURS :-o "here is your mirror, go stare at it for a while" TOUGH huh? did he have a response? deflections kept saying silly shit but he did say but the thing is I am falling for you know now but I might be falling for Misa in a month :( I dunno mikee I don't think I can love this man there are too many obstacles he has terrible addictions and he loves them yeah and he doesn't want to be completely open he's scared "i think it is good to do for the sex and attention, but i really don't think you're going to enjoy dragging him out of his headspace" no it's not even that I won't only enjoy it it's not possible while I could definitely rock Wes' world he wants Misa because she is prolly funny and smart but as he told me she's a pothead he wants someone with just as much honesty as he's willing to take and I am too much for him ! I AM SO FUCKING CONCETED no darling that gets right to the point of it you are definitely too much for him he's afraid his head is going to break open as long as I remember this your right and fitting everything you tell him inside of it at once scares the shit out of him right "the words i'm concerned with are , ""i might... in a month" what kind of bullshit is that but my heart will still be broken I know he wants to love this girl so so what babe? he's committed to her i'm saying he needs to hold on to those things he thinks that is BOND u know? ha he hasn't had his Tedi relationship he's only had his TR get it? i'm saying recognize him for what he really is right now and how that is NOT what you want or need or would fulfill you and keep your heart intact the mind understands that but perhaps the greatest mystery of our being is that the mind speaks a different language than the heart :-/ and we tend to follow the heart sniff well I'm gonna be fine now don't you worry it's basically impossible not to love a person like that because you know the potential right but I think Wes doesn't want to go there it's not even a possibility in some ways he's a hypocrit u know? "yeah, he knows better i think" choosing to remain a child when he knows he's a man he's still the fat kid hiding behind drugs alcohol his cat his fear i think maybe he wasn't as afraid before and let himself slide into it his last relationship? or when we first met? before that OH I SEE that makes sense we slide into these things as we get older gotcha "yeah, Bowling for Columbine syndrome" LOL you're so smart so what to do next? love him like I have cancer? LOL like this shall die in a month? :P one thing tho that needs to asked once more what two things actually first ARE YOU SURE THIS GIRL ISN'T THAT GOOD LOOKING? yes very SWEAR? i swear :F toof toof? why does it matter LOL mikee don't think like a friend right now k think like a fa fag :P "you are superior to her in many, many ways, the LEASST of which is your physical beauty" Thank you I just want to say you are superior to everyone in EVERY WAY ALL THE DAMN TIME :D meh what's the second question swear it oh do you find it interesting that he MIGHT see her in a month? that she hasn't set the date yet? what's with that? that's a tougher one if it were me it wouldn't suprise me because we operate on instinct but it's not me and if it's really that uncertain up to the fates to decide whether it happens "what you mean, instinct?" probably means it's not that set even if she DOES come you mean she'll come when its time that's what i would do but i'm not so sure that's what's happening "he sees it as set, babe" seriously he says that at least to me thing is hmmmm would it really be that much of a struggle if it was an intended thing? yes I see that but wes wants a human to cuddle with not his cat anymore so he's going to find a female feline who'll cuddle up with him when he's wasted and just purrrr and he's going to upend this poor girl from TEXAS to have it? he's so everywhere YES if she wants to move here he thinks this is it she should fucking move here of her own accord I swear I think he wants to marry this girl deep down MEH so boring I wish I could talk to Ian about this but I don't think that's fair what do you think Ian could offer? background on Wes yeah that's what i thought and just insight that you and I don't have I want someone else to tell my WHY this girl is runing my groove thang! :P hahaha Maria yes? in the absence of Misa the situation would be exactly the same she is only a very small part of his fear TRUE the situation is not what I am frustrated with it's my lack of a REAL chance because of SOME TOOFY GIRL haha LOL she's got some teeth on her too :F OH NO :E that kind LOL MIKEE yes u are too much so I dunno um i getting mixed messages from you too but it is mixed but I am OK u know?

I will tell her that yup we'll go a dif weekend k I don't want to pressure you to hang out sorry i just like you no pressure you're my peshe fanks peche hairs so everything is good yeah? yup yup mee n toot talked and we are fine i just listen and told him i thought i was very big of him but listen tedi wrote to wes on the forum no shit and wes knew it was him and he loved the message haha what the hell did he say? I'm trying to find it... where's wes' thing about fear which forum? general "might you know, love?" k hold please ha k wait I can't find it mebbe he sent it as a personal message was it nice? but he told wes that you must face conflict because otherwise it can land you on your face rather than your back or something and then he said with irony often enemies will become great friends ;) "There is an old Chinese proverb that reads, ""In every gain, there is a loss and in every loss there's a gain"" Fear is like that. Even the most brave fear something. Weights and balances, my friend. Fearing conflict is really the worse, though. Your others are just trivial things. Specifics that heal, like everything else, with time. But conflict, fearing conflict is the most debilitating of fears because it leaves you in a constant state of retreat. I write you this now really because a very good friend of mine shared in your phobia, and then one day, he simply dropped off. It really hurt me, and in some ways still lingers, because I never knew the reason why. And when we are left to our own devices to solve something that we simply cannot solve, then one's fear of a temperate conflict leaves another with lasting scars. All I am saying is don't fear conflict. Avoiding the situation brings greater suffering, and makes it last. You only go through this passage of life as this entity once, so why hide from it? Chase your windmills, motherfucka! -Don Q." that? yup but wes must have looked up his name because he said on the phone how does teddy spell his name and i said tedi? why? but tedi had already told me that he wrote him I SMELL RAIN! YESSSSSS! mmm i didn't know that was tedi when i read it Don Q. what a fuck heh it is because he has been talking about Don Quixote lately a lot ah word "strange shit this time of year, homey" TRUE oh hey question for you wes and juan are moving out of wes's house in july al and imri are staying whatchu think? well now Juan got a single so wes has to find his own place and Misa's family is giving her a hard time about moving here and he's all fucking confused and Imri yelled at him on the forum so I told him to come over and he said "I don't think that's a good idea" ... :P heeeee i'm conforked o? about wha? #1 why that isn't a good idea wes has to find a place to live by himself now why him coming over isnt a good idea or him living by himself? #2 because i was thinking you and i could move in at least had the idea OH yeah...

I feel like there's a distance or a negativity i have put a distance between myself and emotions associated with the questions of you and wes that's probably what you feel not between me and you why? because drains u? "i've thought what i've thought about it, and expressed it, and the situation has changed, and i'm not sure if i need to have an opinion" well I APPRECIATE YOUR OPINION but if you feel the discussions of my love life are too circular for you and detachment is the best for you then I completely understand :) put it this way if something strikes me i'm sure we'll talk about it ok nothing has stricken except i was just attacked by a june bug i had to flush it just as long as you don't repress what u feel HUH? are u ok? :F LOL :O fucker came out of nowhere and landed in my lap i'm in my ROOM the best was the chipmunk under your chair mind you OH MY my my peshe didn't mean to kill it maybe he'll wake up in the resevoir awww it's ok and he'll be a man! :P wes said he just wanted kisses oh whatever I need a fucking drink HUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH what kind of a drink? a mint julep the derby was ages ago but we have mint out back ok...now we're cooking why a drink love? mentally and physically exhausted I haven't talked to anyone all day I have 14 voicemails. :P interesting shook off work? I cancelled the program it's over don't tell anyone tho for the rest of the two weeks? no just one week it's over on Friday but I went there today and there was ONE kid so I took all the artwork kissed her goodbye and thanked the school end of story in Wes speak *claps hands twice in upward motion* hey that means you have real time off what a novelty no I have three meetings tomorrow <sigh> are u going to key west? no i cancelled all my trips meow :( y? too much up in the air i need a cushion in some respect cushion for the pushin?! i wish do you need sweet lovin? :( i need sweet chocolate! i'd rather have a trust fund bitch this is your achilies heeel it pops up everynow and then eh actually i haven't been thinking about it specifically only the general lack of options or the lack of general POSITIVE PERCEPTION nope i can be happy with what i have and have few options hmmmm i am thinking NO but only thou knows thyself "generally, a very significant part of my days are spent in very ideal situations" just not much changing probably for lack to true desire to change much you're comfortable some of the very same things that apply to me and tedi apply to you and this situation.... i think not trying to judge :F "there's nothing to affect a change with yet, so i'm not that concerned about missing an opportunity" that wasn't the problem with me and tedi :-/ and yet when it finally adjusted you have several options to present themselves of their own accord not everything presents itself its is cultivated "so far, cultivation has been a highly subconscious process for me" there is a world around u you lack of acknowledgement is incompatible with your desires for material comfort "on the contrary, my lack of acknowledgement has led to a great deal of material comfort" what i lack is emotional comfort dissertate please ... "how many people do you know that perform their workday in such places as the bath, the bed, a hammock, or under the shade of an umbrella? what's more, how many people do you know that travel at to far end of the earth? with some of the finest equipment and clothes available? at their own leisure? all *without* paying a great deal of attention to what most people consider their main concerns." material concerns=not monetary material concerns=expectations of others contradicted with your own #NAME? and self loathing i don't know anyone that isn't self loathing "in fact, i happen to believe it's a very basic characteristic of existence" or at least consciousness u are wounded by the smiling slaves and the workplace is a place of vulnerability for you please accept my apology if I am being too forward :-/ the vulnerability in that respect affords me comforts in others that i wanted for a very long time must keep moving no? we haven't seen anything to move to yet full circle u and I are not in the same mind fram e for once I am thinking in a very Junging Jungian Freudian way u are thinking my usual Buddha "i'm more satisfied now with my ability to make decisions than i have ever been before, and that method of making decisions involves intuiting out the best options, and up to now i haven't felt many viable options, and it's more of an observation than an anxiety that such things happen to be this way" but practice of decision making should extend into your own matters all of them no? practice...action....balance knowing when not to force a decision is often more important than affecting lateral movement knowing when to fashion the outcome is better than claiming detachment often comes as lazy when it mixes with certain situations "eh, most of my best experiences were fashioned under the pressures of doing nothing" you're confusing terms fashioning unequal to presssure fashioning USING pressure i'm not sure our statements differ fashioned under the pressures of doing nothing denotes to me subsisting under conditions ashioning USING pressure denotes using the force to one's advantage actively doing nothing creates the pressures with which to fashion the world externalizes into extremes which bring upon action "my point is, i'm not under the extreme of anything" at this moment i have nothing to act upon ok then shall we question connotations of subsisting and EXisting I think u are CHOSING THIS: i have nothing to act upon qualified: i have nothing to act upon which improves my quality of existence and so what if i choose that? it would take something major to improve at this point how so? I would argue the emotional and why don't u have the major in u? u have been given months of meditation and i find that i'm well placed i just finished the major quite literally ok ok then u are completely complacent [in a positive way] with your situation? "if life changed little for the foreseeable future, then i can be quite satisfied with it, which isn't to say that if it changed quite a lot, i wouldn't be satisfied it" i lead a good life yes that's all i'm saying well I am saying u are a great person and u deserve to fashion your world as u see it but I think its impossible sometimes because u hide I think u are afraid sometimes to put your practice into your understanding hiding doesn't change the experience one bit it comes and finds me I dunno I disagree mebbe I am just being selfish you and tedi and wes are a great example of how my inexpression of relationship manifested into the necessity to deal with every side of the issue at once be more concrete and i don't necessarily prefer either experience I am tired no but those aren't YOUR relationships nope see my frustration at your trepidation i get to contextualize the issues without being emotionally attached and yet still face the same conclusions but mikee we are human beings u can't love and get hurt and gain strength vicariously all in all u can't hide in the garden forever and still complain who is complaining? that u want more mmmm ok this garden has open walls it grows on its own ok eventually everything may be included sure I think you're afraid sorry i don't understand what you think i'm afraid of then forget it "i have already done more, and seen more, and thought more, and created more than just about anyone i know" that's not the point I think you're afraid to go and get what u want and you're defensiveness proves it i have more of what i want now than i have ever had i get what i want i'm not afraid to get it ok ok I disagree my biggest fear "is that at any point i already have everything i want, and won't acknowledge that to be true" "but that is the fear that creates everything else, good and bad, and right now i'm willing to live with it" "as far as going out and getting what i want, i have very little fear of creating experience" i went to tn and got on a motorcycle last best example of me being motivated amazing of u I agree but what about your independence "so, what of it that nothing else like that strikes my fancy" life is boring life is simple not boring my life is definitely not boring i could sit in my back yard and look at chipmunks ok and i would be quite satisfied I disagree :F u want to smack me up side the head no i just don't think you're giving me a lot of credit OH MY NO I am only hard on u because I have been shown so many phenomenal things and I expect more... :P "i get peace right now, and that's what i want" i've fought enough wars to enjoy it I feel the same way and I am most happy for you but remember that when u want the job the apartment the boyfriend "not without the good fight, lover" not without the good fight. i'm retired haha BORING COP OUT FEAR no my darling not fear age ok so u and your grandmom are peers ? u have old balls that's so pretentious mikee i'm definitely older than my grandmother thanks much older stop it well I am going to sleep k i love you I think you're amazing i missed whatever you said last you disappeared i love you too and your rainbows are varied and the depth is more than the known universe! let's wade for a while and look up at the sky then doing that right now and for the next three months at least promis e :f :F : B :E LOL miss u :@ we'll see you soon i think :R we'll? :K the royal we :Q :Z that's me smoking a cig oh my :-z that's taking a dump ok I m going to bed sleep well u too love u bee bee love you 2 peesh hair! sister g.a.c.

Listen to the structure behind a piece and think about how you might write an algorithm to create that structure. Once you start writing the code you'll start to get more ideas based upon it, so that the eventual music sounds nothing like what you found inspiration from." "yeah, just the idea of live coding is pretty crazy" connected to music is really convergent good stuff it could completely refresh the scene tho reinvent it u know? it could the talent bar goes way up tho only a few people could do it at least at first TRUE but might make the scene viable again not just any idiot u know? ha oh guess what?! what tree is going to bartending school :P YAY isn't that great? good IDEA I wanna do that I KNOW I think I'm gonna try to bartend $$$ :P "yeah, i want a yob at bump" like two nights a week hmmm get it then where me? sisters/ "D" :F heh silk city me? silk city? i've ne'er been it's a neat place mebbe imri can help me get a gig good for something have you talked to him at all>? no he's here tho "yeah, i keep hearing somebody shuffle up and down the steps" shuffle shuffle might be a snuffle snuffle lump ah ha sooo i need a cig k wanna meet up sometime?

I didn't actually want to talk about it he kept pressing the matter I walked away but he kept saying you're so negative you're so negative and I'm not I'm just tired today I don't want to talk I don't want to fight I don't have a good opinion right now but he kept pressing is he still here? of course not he always leaves but that wasn't necessarily a bad idea i don't think so he's been here since sunday I just hate when he leaves on a bad note it hurts my head my advice is pretty thin I don't need any I just need to be cut some slack sometimes you're the only person who can do that wes is hard on me y do I have to be presented with everything all the time and respond positively you don't have to respond positively right? you choose to I mean when I tell you certain things same way you don't always say GO FOR IT you can choose to take things seriously or cut yourself some slack and not and I understand I mean he changes his mind so much last weekend he talked about opening a restaurant this weekend its school ok that bothers you? its confusing you're taking him too seriously um ok if you know he changes his mind regularly see what floats to the top and see what settles and don't drive yourself nuts by trying to filter it yourself ok I just hate it when he says I don't support him because I feel like I really do and he doesn't appreciate all I do for him "again, your perception" you're torturing yourself maybe it's not communicated well enough between you to be recognized mutually ok I see and it scares me because I don't think I am a negative person I HATE being called that maybe that's why you hear it a lot? because I don't want to be or because I am ha what? am I? I am horrible. see? LOL :'( now that's some negativity i honestly don't believe that there's a wide variation of negative to positive between individuals within their lifetimes deciding which side of the fence you sit on is an immediate process and something that only the individual has perspective on someone's negative is someone else's positive oh? that makes me feel a little better what're you doin?

I'm a bit overwhelmed "its been a problem, and my program starts on Friday" and no one's been here to do anything there's trash every where I had to move all the shit in the basement and be in contact with the realtor so I'm not sure that its anyone's fault "in fact, it's prolly not" I just wish I had a bit of help at the important time i'm sorry that it happened while the house is empty most of that is beyond your responsibility though oh no i don't htink you have anything in the basement right? Imri was here I did in fact but there was other people's shit too at this point i have very little i can offer in the way of support I'm very aware of that but I do know that you are ill i feel like dogshit and i worked anyway sorry to hear that "yeah, it's this week i think" generally it's been the worst one i've seen for a LONG time fucked up part of the cycle hmmm "however, if you need me to come back, i could make it on friday" and come back here on sat I need nothing thanks "anyway, beyond that, how is the program shaping up?" fine thanks how is working with your dad? pretty well considering. i think he's sick too some random dude showed up to go with us today to learn how to do it we were done by 12 though nice "but is a long day after gettin up at 4, no?" 8 hours one way or the other i've been taking kitty crack i think that's what's got me i feel like i did when i was with johnnathan. like all the way aroudn strike that with Eric kitty crack? Sudafed or something? yeah daytime/nighttime what happened to the Keflex? "plus that, plus Tylenol, plus Claritin" operating on autopilot i watched this crazy fucked up movie last night Monster with Charlize Theron i think very good yeah scary how much she reminds me of my Aunt Syd in that flick it's like the way she *could* have gone "same mannerisms, different attitude" hmm I just picked my nose :) did you eat it nope wipe it on the cat? wes' shirt that he left here :) shit my battery is going to die brb back ok so what are ya doin tonight?

"what was your New Year's resolution?, and have you fulfilled it?" say what? "Can't say that I've fulfilled mine, but I'm about to. " this is his post on the forum "he's always asking about change, embetterment" about to? like posting it on a goddamn forum about to what? is going to do anything you know i don't even go there much anymore? just self-help I know I go to have hip hop arguments with joey that's all heh maybe he's trying to convince himself i wonder what his resolution was? prolly quit smoking ah anywho by the by mm? do we need to talk about my foolishness that happened on sunday? y? i'm just checking I was a little surprised it was a weird situation and I was suprised that Imri knew ha he knew that we hooked up? yup interesting he said there was some freaky shit but he didn't care I was more surprised but you know I'm far from judgemental when it comes to you i've been judging myself well not really but i really rode it off the rails I just thought the girl was unactractive ha i know in a way yes in a way not at all hmmm her mind is amazing the question is did u have fun? wow tough question oh because if the answer was yes then the subject's over apparently you have the issue not i ;) just the whole weekend was out of control oh i feel really shitty about kissing wes so what? !?! why? because that's WAY over the line that's like to you? not something you want to do to your straight friends I don't think you should talk to me about that then... because they shouldn't have to consider the possibility cause I never gave it a thought hey I smooched joey several times it's like riding the lighting i really feel like i grabbed hold with both hands and killed summer wow "ok then, robert frost" :-/ "it's the drugs, m'dear" oh I get it except for the last part ha killd summer summer is dead as of this weekend like you build up oh and keep building I gotcha until it overloads I feel like summer's been dead and then in decline i guess i missed the memo no it's purely internal but the solstice was on the 21st of sept :) "anyway, we're going to rein it in a little" thanks for talking to me i love you i love you too thanks for talking to you? yeah ummm...k... that's a strange comment but ok you're welcome i'm just grateful at this moment sure Peshe hair HAAARRREEE yay for conan thanks mikee I am really confused over? my mind is crazy as soon as I told joey I couldn't see him anymore I missd him more than ever that's not out of the ordinary and I was a total bitch to wes you want to know my opinion? go ahead if you have the enrgy "i think either he and/or you is making a mistake by trying to avoid each other. no matter what the dynamic, you're surpressing energy that's everntually going to manifest itself one way or the other" so fuck it and just let it go "yeah, i think trying to do it any other way is useless torture" but cheating on wes? that can't happen ok there are several many ways to see that it doesn't and i think the option you each want to choose out of the best of intentions is the most difficult one to maintain I agree but discipline brings better reward we reap what we sow "as long as you're not cutting yourself off from all the options, that's true" "i think if you were more willing to consider the possibility that wes and joey could operate in different roles in your life, you'd be less drawn to changing the roles they have now" hmm explain that more conretely please you remove the temptation by accepting its consequence and then energy flows without the blockage dangerous advice because you're surrendering in a way putting it up to faith "if wes, then wes" "if joey, then joey" wow ok "if wes, not joey is what's holding you" but what if I'm just flowing to joey because he gives me the attention i like totally possible and i think it's a pretty valid observation "does not matter though, does it?" nope I just don't want to be overly selfish all motives are selfish i don't think you can avoid it but I don't want to fuck with someone well that's the only thing you have control over myself I know but I don't I kissed him and I don't twant to lead him one on i think you're afraid of losing what you have yes! of course i am "worst case scenerio: wes finds out, joey doesn't enter into a new relationship" that's not the worst case at all I don't want a new relationship i wonder if that's honest it is ok i just want to have fun with whomever I'm with that may be honest no more taking to the family no more visting the family no more sleeping over all the time but here's the deal: ? "if you're not willing to accept having two relationships, then wes needs to know about joey" he does I told him yesterday no Monday no yesterday sorry heh :F good the hard part is over u know I couldn't do tha t I mean he doesn't know all of my feelings but he knows I am tempted and he knows I kissed Joey but he tried to convince me it was out of sympathy and I disagreed tried to convince himself maybe he doesn't seem scared to lose me ... i don't think he should be "if you're scared of losing someone, you obviously aren't secure in the relatlonship" i dunno i think if you aren't afraid then you aren't into it also a possibility I mean I agree with you but I think your assumption is too idealisitc it's the best possible understanding but it's like how i feel about my grandparents i mean to say it's possible "fear is going to be part of any normal relationship, but if you ever found someone where the fear went away, that's the person you should marry" it is hmmm I trust wes a lot i do love wes I just need him to get a job and get the fuck out of my hair and not just come here when he needs something i'm sure you love wes and I think the attraction with Joey is because shit is hard with wes right now may mostly be it not that joey is really better besides I had someone who was JUST like me and we fought the same fight all the time wes has taught me not to be so afraid when we fight and wes walks away i used to bugg out but now I trust that if he loves me he'll come back or if he doesn't I'm better off I was always holding tedi in a fight just to keep him around i don't need that with wes he helps me maintain my independence i've never wanted to be alone more since i met wes besides I don't find joey sexy i just like that he is slightly obsessed with me ha i think some of that is rationalization "in that absence of wes, you would still enjoy joey" yes you didn't think wes was attractive either hmmm right well I see what you mean sigh i dunno you came to a great conclusion whassat i think you're learning from the experience and i think you learned quickly i think you're not done learning from wes or from joey or from both same issue hmm k eh strike that we'll see where it goes new issue what you said just now was an old issue huh? :-/ whachumean? "the tedi/wes comparison, as opposed to the wes/joey comparison" "one is recently gained knowledge, the other is a new question" right not the only comparisons to be made but logically seperate ahh I see I think joey is like tedi he makes me miss tedi a lot A LOT he is a more mature tedi maybe so although "you've just concluded that you are not the same person that you were with tedi, nor is joey like the tedi that you were with" right and joey does certain things that I always said I wanted in a man he came after me he waits for me and he had the balls to say the other night I understand why you're doing this but I just think I'm better for you you defintely deserve that kind of attention spanks he's also a Libra my astrological match but that's corny ga ja "i'm not saying it's ""better"" attention than wes can give you" but it's good attention right but you give me that and you are my friend maybe joey's just meant to be my friend that's false hope oh? yeah y? you're hoping over what you know to be true. PUCH OUCH it would be terribly convenient YES damn you little fucker sorry no no "i can give you a certain amount of intimacy, but not on the level that someone *like* Joey will offer" i know personally i think you deserve the whole package fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck everything you get out of wes PLUS everything you get out of Joey I think I do too Sylvester LOL are you referring to that dream I had? yes wierd I was just reading that email today ... so wierd "yeah, this week has us all fucked up" that's fo sho yup ok I gotta run ok thanks for this i love you i love you too feel better thanks have fun with the kidros make sure you dissappear tomorrow it might flood here ;) heh :P if you need me CALL fine if during the day 8563320549 but remember your little friend that's my dad's cell ok? ok thanks you be in my heats that's all I ask hearts heats hah k heated feel better ok bi bi poppet sniffles snuffle lolo ja uupppogas right <poof> mikee aye the damn pilot light is out again I forget how to light it jiggle the nipples MIKEE I haven't showered since Tues mornin :( ew I need hot water yes arrrr I couldn't earlier since the plumber was here sigh and Imri is coming home but he's gonna yel :-/ yell? meeeeow because of the damn thread and the realtor tell him to stfu and light the water heater k hope he comes home soon realy all you have to do is turn the nob my butt stinks and hold it down and light it "but turn it off first, right?" there should be instructions ok I ll try be back k if i'm not back call me ok if I don't answer call 911 heh :P i'll call imri riiight and tell him that our realtor called about the pilot light and how he's not being responsible and that i'm sure they're right LOL ok going now peshe brb k i'm too scared good grief call your boyfriend and make him do it he's at work mikee its scary yes what if I blow UP? can i have your powerbook?

However. fill in the argument ... i dont know what ur thinkin you could pretty much pick an issue "he's like, the anti-me" better yet Dick Cheney is the anti-me i wouldnt say anti u - or me - why anti u i don't lie to people on a regular basis i dont think the pres does either as a matter of a fact - as he stated in his press conf - the one thing u can count on - is when he says something he will do it "he doesn't have the ability to consider alternate points of view, and that makes him a bad manageer" no i would say he is a very good manager - because he enables his ppl around him - and trust what they say the people around him advise him with biased information TRUE because it is impossible not to be bias on any issue the ppl around him - have a like minded agenda - its the agenda of the ppl who put him office i disagree. presenting something subjectively doesn't go as far as omitting critical information in order to sell a point that's bad business and r u refering to iraq no not just then what the perscription drug benefit the epa and on and on what about the benifis a week after it was passed we found out the administration supressed the true cost from the congress see my issue is this - they say he didnt do a good job with the econ - now they are seeing that the bush tax cuts worked they say he did nothing with persecipt drugs for elders - no its not the best -but its a start and better then what they had it's also going to cost one hundred fifty Billion more than they were willing to admit to No Child Left Behind is a regular disaster and the piece de resistence an Amendment against people like me now this is where u will not like me building discrimination back into our constitution because - i think the pres is right on that issue he had no other choice when liberal courts decide to make laws - then elected officials - have no other recourse i thnk that marriage is defined as that of a man and woman - i do support civil unions - but when u go and redefine marriage thats an issue marriage is a legal contract that falls under the rights of equal protection no judge made any law marriage lic is a legal act but marriage as it is defined - is that of a man and woman the legal definition is the only one the counts moral definitions are contrary to founding principles but they are what the ppl know and they are what the ppl want not what i want tell me why a civil union will not work for u legislating morality is tyrrany ignoring it is detrimental to society the romans did quite well for themselves so what made rome fall "given enough time, everything changes" lets hope not change is the only constant that's physics true - but maybe we need to change back some things "well as long as we're revoking civil rights, there are a few i think you might want reconsider" what civil rights are we revoking "the stuggle i have is - how do u compare ones sexuality which is a personal and private issue with that of blacks, woman and other minorities - its not the same" it most certainly is no it is not explain how homosexuality isn't a choice or at least see and that is where we differ i think it is made before we can be held responsible for it explain most people know they're gay before they hit puberty but what about those who dont? do they make a choice i don't think you can call instinct a choice and i dont think you can outlaw instinct and i think instinct is just as basic as sex or race i would disagree and see thats the difference - ur taking something that is not tangable and using it against a tanagble item and trying to make an argument with it now - so that u understand I am fine with my sexuality - its not something that i hide - but at the same time - it is not something i flaunt either the greatest form of acceptance for me - is when someone tells me they dont care because - the same way i dont want to know what my girlfriend and her bf are are doing in bed - is the same way i dont want to know who my gay friends are sleeping with how can you translate the choice of ignorance into a constitutional amendment? it is not a choice of ignorance "i don't want to know" i understand there are legal reason why a gay couple would want the legal benifits of a married couple "insurance, etc" i support that and you can't accept that they want to make the same level of commitment>? under their own beliefs ? under a perfectly acceptable belief system? but isnt that pushing their believe system on everyone else no because their marriage doesn't affect your beliefs but its not an acceptable belief system to everyone how are you harmed by gay marriage? it does when it opens the door for any other type of act because of course all homosexuals are pedophiles no not at all that's the implication remember u r talkin to one my lifestyle doesnt' open the door to bad things for other people ur lifestyle no but this act of gay marriage does what to say that a person says hey - if 2 guys can get married - then i want a 2nd wife - or even stranger i want to marry my goat - as crazy as it sounds - thats what can happen - and thats what ppl are afraid of why do you care what other people choose to do with their lives you just said you don't want to know about it how would you feel its a morality issue if someone started caring about things you do and prevented you from doing them and morality affects society lol what's the difference between you and the worse redneck? i am blk that's a coincidence but prob not much more then that - in ur thinkin and a convenience how so your argument is no different than Jerry Falwell's. it's just blunted. i have issues with Jerry but my issues with Jerry are a lil different then i'm surprised you forward his ideals its not his ideals now grant u - i am prob the biggest oxymoron in the world that's not a justification no but it does affect my thinkin and choices "see i am was raised one of those conservative right wing christians, went to Christian school - college - hell i even had a full ride to Jerry's school -" I understand the thought pattern of them for the most part - outside of me being gay - i am one and i struggled and you were able to reconcile your sexuality with that moral code? because the only way to do that is develop your own belief system its hard - trust me it is truly difficult which every individual at least in this society has a right to do that supercedes every other right nah - my believe system is still intact i would say but it's your own it isn't the party line no not at all it isn't what's in the book you've made up your own exceptions to the rule see - my issue with Christians today in regards to homosexual is simple no i made no exception to the rule if asked - i tell my christian friends and anyone then you must hate yourself i make a conscience decision to do something that i know is wrong - and i dont have myself for it you would be willing to be thrown in jail if you were caught? "but see Christians - they can forgive ever other type of sinner, from a murder, to a child molester, a thief - but we alienate the homosexual and wonder why they dont want to have anything to do with us - and its a fear issue - caus the reality of it is in the Chruch in great numbers" and for my believes - i think i can say i would be willing to be thrown in jail yes see its a lot easier to say something - and more difficult to act on it and you've accepted the dictate that according to your own beliefs you're going to burn in a Christian hell? well according to my Christian believe system I dont burn in hell for my sins - i burn in hell for rejecting Christ according to Paul you reject Christ with your sins see the great think about Christ and Christianity is - every other religion is based on what u do - but Christianity is based on what Christ did - and once u accept Christ - there is nothing u can do to lose it - its there for good i hope that works out for you "it does - and see the good thing is - i knew that before i started acting on my homosexual ""instint" yours is only one interpretation of Christianity among Christians many of them don't agree with you and i would argue to them prove it in the bible the bible is full of contradictions lol and things we find morally reprehensible u may think - but to a christian - it is the basic of life - and everything one needs for life is in it so if they argue Christianity any other way then mine - they better be able to back it up - thats all i am saying what if a Christian put to you the Bible's interpretation of a womans place? explain u mean to be submissive not just women deserved to be stoned when they disobey? under the law "old testament - under law new testament - under grace" wow - i didnt think i would end up on this conversation these are the only ones that matter to me good to know i prob didnt score many points with u then :-) "eh, you have the strength of conviction" which is respectable but the logical ends of your arguments are places i don't go thank u u know i tend not to bring up my religious opinion esp when i am talkin to gays - i try to keep it to myself for that very reason - and others i don't talk about religion or politics as anything but intellectual exercises well i think politics esp this election will be a major decididng factor in our nation i would consider leaving if we continue with the current policy really yes why is that it's depressing to watch malice spread explain i don't enjoy judgemental people or policies made at the expense of of others every policy is made at the expense of others "if you believe that, then you have less understanding of creativity than i expected" no no i am very creative and understanding - but the bottom line is that is true name any policy - and someone is not happy with it "not everyone has to be happy, they just deserve to be considered." agreed i couldnt agree with u more "not prejudicially considered, but actually listened to" i agree but that means all side I dont mind those who disagree with me - i think thats a good thing - and provide balance - and I dont always have to win - as long as the decisions that is reached is the best one for everyone - its all about balance - i think it's pretty fair to say that the past four years have given us legislation that isn't in the best interests of everyone haven't i wouldnt say that at all ok enough ok how bout this i have to run - but next time we chat - lets just talk about ur excellent movie selection ok enjoy your night cya cutie yeah i have to lay carpet - its going to be a blast enjoy urs - and hopefully we can see past our differnces - and maybe chill one day but i get to pick the movie :-P k hey whats up hottie up early what's up with you? just working ugh yes? I hate to be stuck in kville during spring break everyone else is off having orgiastic sex but me :-\ you need a hooker i need to get laid quite honestly the gayest boy in the world just came up to the desk did you ask him how much? he got an attitude with me which I did not appreciate over? the location of the copy machines figures here he comes again ask him how much? hahah he's pretty cute he's not cute enough to get a free bitching pass that's true he had the nasty attitude...not the fun gay bitchy attitude maybe he isn't getting laid either could be...I know my attitude has deteriorated since my last flogging ew flogging? sorry...bad joke fine..since my last fucking "I may go home, get naked, and go to bed" that's usually what i do I don't like to lay naked though then don't ? well i guess that makes sense that's what i'm here for so I'm staying with some fag at penn when I come did I tell you? no well i am on purpose? that's who I was put with i don't quite understand how this information gets circulated the fact the some people suck dick? yes well...it does you have experience with Penn...you should be the one tellingme i would be kind of shocked if the university used that as a way to assign something at least in my case well...I guess the dude thinks the queers will feel more comfortable staying with other queers it sounds like they're going out of their way to get you to come well...i think it's just part of their whole plan but it does make sense I kept me from having to get a hotel for 3 nights I only had to get it for one night make him take you out he is...the lambda law people are taking all the q's out ok...my shift is over thank god I am going to the house I will talk to you later k i want to send martha some flowers send her a cake witha file in it haha...such a tragedy some big bulldyke is gonna make her a bitch i bet you she gets her own suite the said on cnn that the BOP would make sure she didn't get special treatment I just hope she gets kitchen duty i think my cable just wen tout that sucks nothing on really queer eye was on it's old well...did it? back on that's good should i watch a dvd tonight? yes moulin rouge? why not Leauge of their own? perhaps Steel magnolias? better Ghostbusters classic I have bought like 15 in the last 2 weeks wow have you watched them all? no 3 of them so you have 12 to choose from? well...I own 43 so I could watch an old one i love this damn movie which one Moulin rouge why so much? the music I love Baz Luhrman kyan gets nekkid a lot yes he makes me moist did you buy Mommie Dearest? yes wait no "I think you talked about it, but I wasn't sure if you did" i got Whatever Happened to Baby jane did you like it? it was ok I like it...not sure I need to own it though it's on tv a lot hey big boy how's it going? all right at work how are you? doing very well...I'm at my friend's house in Nashville spring breaking? yeah..pretty much we are working on theses ect. but going out as well where to?

I DON'T WANT TO HEAR OR TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE" k this was the bitching? yeah...this is a culmination we used to hang out like 2-3 times a week and since this whole law school thing started she has shunned me why I have no idea she has been acted weird since it started she had a nervous breakdown of sorts on me several times because her test score was higher than mine yet she is going to a less respected school oh for fucks sake "she was like ""I wish I could be black or gay"" so I could go to a top school" and I let her have it for that where is she going? U of Georgia "I was like ""Penn didn't know I was queer until AFTER i got in." i thought that's what you wrote you essay on "yeah...I wrote a diversity essay on it, BUT i didn't send it to Penn" because penn makes you wrote 2 essays based on specific things "I wrote one about our farm and the other one is ""Why Penn?" maybe I am just being nuts but we haven't been the same since December the stupid thing is that it's such a fucking joke the ivy league is ridiculous just a ridiculous concept there are other schools that are SO much better simply because they don't pull idiots with rich parents Yeah...it is ridiculous but unfortunately the only thing that counts in law jobs when you graduate is prestige i signed my loan papers today you're officially owned indentured servant "if you need to find me in Philly, I will be on the corner give blowjobs for $20.00" "I have whored myself to the ""man"" and it actually feels good" the desktop you made me caused quite a ruckus in class today howso I had to give a presentation in class so when I turned the projector on it showed up "and everyone was like ""what is that?" your response?

I dont know I think so it sounds like it has decent eye candy yeah I cant wait to see Real World tomorrow no shit i had MTV on last night while i was sculpting and the clips look interesting yeah i'm a little bit sad i missed them I met the crue oh yeah? they seem awesome but the producers wasnt sure if we'de be in on tv how did you meet them? they were welcoming the troops back and I was one of the troops from Philly coming home but I dont think they are gonna put that on tv cause thats kinda confidential stuff oh yeah? yea did you enlist after high school? yeah but I am not a soldier I'm an officer hmmm i didn't know you could do that i had some friends at west point well I went to college first ah ROTC so how old are you now? 25 nuts what? that you're already finished with your commitment it took me seven years to graduate with a business degree time flys when you have good time ha no kidding so do you have a boyfriend? not for a while just dont want one? i didn't for a long time i'm starting to change my mind or at least i'm more open to the idea so you're just enjoying your single life? going out hooking up thats cool eh not exactly like that like i said all my friends are straight so there's really not that much hooking up plus i've been away a few times where at? first SF then honolulu my last bf was about two years ago what did you do there? right before i went to HIO HI i waited out the winter ha actually lol i started writing my thesis hence the seven years right I wish I could find one guy who would want more out of this life then just having fun all the time you mean like kids? no most of the guys I meet just want hook ups or being a fuck buddy etc... nothing else hmmm well i can't speak for anyone else but I guess being overseas especially in Bosnia and after seeing what happened there I dont want to waste my life on taht that i think it works for certain periods of life i don't think it is always fulfilling i'm not fulfilled by it but then again it's not really my take right to each his own I have some awesome friends but they are so wild wild? go go boys escorts porn stars etc.... fun I love them but I could NEVER live like that "yeah, my crowd out in san francisco was similar" ha you live vicariously? in what sence? "your friends all have this lifestyle, so at least you're exposed to it" yeah they love me back so its all that matters i used to be a wild child actually when I was in rehab many of my friends did they were all by my side good friends yeah what was your weapon of choice? well we dont really have a choice its whatever we get asigned to us ha sorry i meant the rehab are you talking physical rehab or drug dependency? now i feel stupid lol I was shot oh shit see there you go and couldnt walk for almost a year intense this happened in 1997 i was thinking you had a healthy crack habit no I dont do drugs anymore been clean since 1997 lol getting shot was the best thing that ever happened to me in a sence it transformed my life around but horrible time what did you learn from the experience? "sorry, wrong button" i'm back ok so yeah how many roomies do you have? 5 including me wow thats a lot it's always a party cheap rent though nice house you have your own room? yup I guess thats not bad nah i know everyone here too we were friend before we moved in together and none of them are gay? my best friend maria i guess you could call bisexual but she's dates boys mostly i'd like more gay friends it would make it easier to hunt yeah although most gay dudes i don't like so go figure I agree totaly I dont click with many of them and most of gay guys are VERY superficial and vain and thats just to sad "i'm pretty vain, but i'm not superficial" sometimes to my own detriment it's easy to be shallow lol I think its a turn off sure i'm not nearly as vain as i used to be... so that's an improvement "i guess by the time i'm 40 i should be normal, yet ugly" ha joke lol actually i wonder if it's vanity if you only care about your own opinion and no one elses probably even more so all I can say is whatever makes you happy for for it looking good makes me happy and it should you are beautiful guy only from certain angles lol from other's i'm just me and thats the best i'm satisfied with it i think that may be my out on relationships though i haven't run across a gay boy who agrees maybe they find you intimidating? that's pretty par for the course or maybe you just have a look that you dont want anything serious? but frustrating and stupid nah i actually fall into relationships really easily under the right circumstance s really it's anyone who says yes eh that's an odd way of putting it oh I c put it this way i've had 3 boyfriends in my life each of which just happened all of a sudden none of which lasted very long aww sorry all of which i learned from don't be i value the experience but thank you anyway I only had 2 serious bfs one was 4 years one was 1 year four years is beyond my comprehension hell one year is too yeah it was awesome I miss them all a lot or maybe just the sex? I dont know LOL nah them probably i find it difficult to keep sex interesting after a while unless you're willing to really play like kids actually the 4 year one was never boring we liked to spice it up in the bedroom so always hot times in what ways? oh you name it he was kinda on the dominant side so it would get wild good for you i like to switch it up a lot in what way? "toys, slings, props, you name it" the only thing i think i'm over as far as relationships are concerned are groups i'm too much of a jealous bastard i guess lol I never did groups I am very jelous type much better when you're single IMO I would kick their ass if they touch my man yeah my last bf insisted on threesomes because that was how he like to keep sex interesting but waking up to him with someone else was too much i went postal sorry man I could NEVER do that to me if a guy asks for a 3some it only shows that he is no longer interested in me that I dont do anything for him anymore "yeah, it was a pretty loose thing anyway i guess, in retrospect" i got kicked out of my house with him I dated this one guy for like 3 weeks so we were sticking together for a while on a 3rd week he asked if we could have a 3some I was like bye bye yeah i think i'd really love it if someone were that protective over me but it hasn't happened yet well I dont know my X didnt like that "he thought I didnt ""trust him" cause I am very very protective of my man hmmm to what extent? but he loved the fact I would get jelous if someone tried to hit on him he actually did it on porpuse to see me get all edgy that bitch lol heh i'd have to say it would be sexy in a way i think it would turn me on but then again then he would come to me and kiss me infront of everyone and call me silly i'd hate to be accused of something i didn't do nah he was cool he would tell whoever came up to him straight up that he is with me but of course some fags cant take no for an answer heh so do you go out in Philly? so thats when I step it and kick their ass I dont know anyone in Philly so dont go out much did you parents just move here? my parents moved here long time ago but I never really spent any time here ok do you live in the suburbs or the city? in NE Philly what kind of nightlife do you like? what do you mean? do you like to dance? bars? house parties? coffee shops? not really a dancer type I like bars house parties rock you should come to our halloween party if you're around the kids i live with are djs and throw a lot of parties around town we have a house party for halloween that is off the hook oh I'd like that alot i don't go to many straight bars because i'm definitely a dancer thats cool I like that but I cant dance everybody can dance I guess because in the Military we just learn to observe and protec so I am on the look out all the time LOL ha well after a while somebody needs to look after me because i tend to go overboard lol with pleasure my friends are great about that though they keep me walking thats good there are a few i think you would like a lot mostly the straight of the straight frat boys but not like animal house more like a country club lol biggest problem with them is they're pretty cute unfortunately "for some reason, almost all of my friends are hot" lol so are mine then i guess you'd fit right nin what type of guys do you usually go for? I mean what is your preference wow i'm trying to pick a certain one really if they're well put together then just tell me what you like iit makes me hot i love latins i like boys who are pretty cut i like a structured face i like small boys but then again i like tall thin boys ethnic flavor is always a plus accents are a real turn on as well as foreign languages cool I speak 5 ha compliments from uncle Sam give him my regards really and truely looks go so far and then i really get off on intellect but must come with looks well I am def not your type then unfortunately why do you say that? you know what though i'm much better about finding someone's inner light i see some really beautful things in a lot of people what I mean is looks wise I wont be your type but I have everything else you like after I was shot unfortunately my body went to hell with it I used to be very lean mean fighting machine but after I got shot and couldnt walk for so long doctors forbid me to do anything physical till my spine heals that was in 98? 97 will your spine heal? yeah doctors said it usually takes up to 10 years nice "not so nice, really" at least it will heal though hey you know what? what I rather be walking and being out of shape then being in a wheelchair i can understand that i'm not in great shape myself i was in better shape lol when i ate every other day I was captain of my wrestling team so I was hard ripped toned boy before every fags dream lol now just a nightmare eh i think you're as good looking as you believe you are like i know i'm out of shape but i also know that i look good so ... it just sucks man what kind of trouble does it really cause? you have had serious long term relationships "I found it to be hard to make friends, just as easy as that" gay people are very mean very true they judge you just by the looks which is sad i think it depends on where you meet them in a club definitely true in a bookstore eh anywhere man not so much I never had luck meeting anyone decent only luck I had was in Europe in Bosnia and Kosovo for example gay guys LOVED me I was fucking stalked lol ok so here in US no one even talks to me one guy said I look str8 or very intimidating which is bull shit was this in philly? yeah although I didnt have any problem in San Fran I made tons of friends in one week that I was there it was kinda sad to leave have you thought about going back? of course have you checked craigslist? for what?

"that seems like the more ""real"" job to me" just need some stability. who knows? i hear that i'm interviewing with Patrick's company next week just to make sure i have something to do for the next year awesome Patrick has enjoyed it I suppose "Yeah, he's not the only one i know of" well keep me updated on what happens i think maria is going to drag my ass one way or the other "she had a little breakdown yesterday, and i had to promise that I would go with her on vacation" where ya gonna go?

Capitolizing on markets that aren't saccurated, basically" i like london it's worthwhile i don't waste my time ever i've worked in more than a few startups "really, if you have funding, the job is much easier, however, i've found very few that were profitable before 5 years" it's all good it's not so much a company i'm starting at first...it'll be mainly me and a partner most likely. more along the lines of devolpement-type things but lets not discuss it whatever suits you i'm drawn to the topic by instinct "no, i care to discuss it...just not when i'm tired. i'm trying to get sleepy b/c i have to be up at 6:30...i get into the topic and don't fall asleep" lol "well, how shall i deliver you into sleep?" just normal boring convo lol how was your thai? good good "this evening, i went over to a girl's house on south street to watch the first episode of her on a new reality tv show" it was a character study where do you go for it? penn there's an amazing little place up next to the rite aid on walnut and 22nd bring your own bottle hehe i go to one on 40th and Chestnut i was making dough when you sent the message about dinner fun times http://neocyde.net is my site fun did u design it? yes i spent the last year as a graphic designer for a startup in philly http://smilingscreens.com cool...the final links don't work though like after the index interesting i never have that problem on my mac but i've heard that from some ppl with pcs it's just flash "i know...i've worked with flash. in 7th grade, i was a computer loser who knew html and worked with java...when it took forever to load" so tell me about your rub down last night cut guy who works at bump late twenties oh ok not the type of guy i would see you with interesting we had martinis talked local politics went upstairs ... at one point i was on the corner of the waterbed bent over backwards and gripping the wall for all it was worth i have a nice mark on my back for my trouble very hot indeed then i put him to sleep with some energy work fun no sex? ha "bent over backwards gripping the wall for all it was worth""?" what do you think could put me into that position? i thought u were getting a massage post massage i skipped over that part oh u bttmed? both vers i started on top "incidentally, what type of guy do you think i would be seen with?" "well, granted you don't have a great body. you're skinny...at least that what it appears in your pics. so that lowers your standards" ha just not a gay bar bartender that's pretty funny the boys i'm with are very well put together http://neocyde.net/art/smallwonder.html first boyfriend http://neocyde.net/art/figment.html second bf omg...gross way not what i expected i think it has to do with the colors "but still, not what i expected" i thought more along preppy lines i was a party kid when i dated them then you're contridicting yourself how is that? well put together VS party kids not establishing a clear case with me ;) but i just enjoy giving you a HARD time i don't see why those things are mutually exclusive however i see the point you're making and i can only say that we're talking about a span of about five years it's ok...not everyone is as perfect as i am nor do i expect them to live up to my standards O:-) <--- ugly on the inside and out "when i was your age, i looked like this: http://neocyde.net/built.jpg" now i look like this: http://neocyde.net/bathtime2.jpg good to make improvements i know...i have the 2nd one saved that pretty much sums it up i'm curious and doubtful you look as hot as your 2nd pic in real life i think u lucked up and took an amazing pic it's possible most people don't think so i get an excellent response when i'm out as do i but i'm really not that attractive ;) "after a certain point, hot boys are just hot boys. i've been with enough to know they're interchangable" the thing is that i'm not just hot...i have the entire package...and most people throw themselves at me for one reason or another which i'm sure you'll do "actually, i think you'll be more attractive in about 5 years, when you're secure enough in it to not need to acknowledge it" hahaha...i'm really not as cocky about it as i appear on here. you're just chatting with me after i've been ripping apart a whartonite tonight it's a game for me but that's another story "at last, i am sleepy!!!" lol please don't think i'm a cocky ass...i was just dick'n around "i'm a very sweet guy, nothing all that special" "dr jekyll, meet mr hyde" haha...which ones the real me? i suspect you're probably what you say or am i still playing with your head however you're also on the far side of a lot of things i learned a long time ago it's easy to be a big fish however the point is to conceal your power until you truly need to call on it "people like us recognize each other for what we are, without having to put it on display" i met someone today in fact "if you're self-aware, you convey it nonverbally" "we're online, nothing is ever verbal. but one lesson i have learned is don't pass judgments and attempt to analyze something online...online is just a giant fake force. i believe if you encountered me in real life, things would be much different." clearly indeed but i must sleep sleep well "thank you for making me smile...i think under the horn dog that you appear to be online, you're more than a cute face...we'd probably get along quite well" we'll have to conduct that experiment eventually at a date to be determined in the future yeap...the king has left the building...peace out do you have plans for the friday before halloween? i don't know why? we're having a house party what's that date? i'll check 29th cool...i don't think i am. i'd love to come what kind of party? "invite only, several djs, all kinds of party favors" how many people? "no idea, last year it was invite only and we ended up with over a hundred" the house was packed to the gills and it's a *house* "and of course you should realize if i'm coming, i must bring a friend or 2...for comfort" yes please do cool but there may be a list so let me know closer to the date and i'll put you on it ok...just remind me b/c i forget np what r u doing on halloween? henry david ball? i haven't thought about it yet. basically i think that wherever this party leads to is where i'll be it will most likely be a weekend long bender yea if i had to take a guess i'd say Zete's at Penn fun i guess "years ago it was the best party of the year. now, i only know alumni, so i'm taking a wait and see attitude" Henri David Ball is the big thing now or it was last year the wildest party "and your ticket price goes towards AIDS research, i do believe" where is it held? last year i think it was at the Wyndum who throws it? Henri David lol for some reason i thought he was dead ok so i've got to go wash out my paintbrushes i'll catch up with you later btw it's a costume party enjoy your night how went the midterm? "umm, ok...not the best" statistics is bullshit anyway don't sweat it "yea, i think it's pointless." who were you with at outfest? 3 girls who was the boy in the orange shirt? bartender at pure and bump...he's kinda dating tiffany he's straight? yea damn haha sorry to disappoint you it's ok he was just the cutest thing i saw walking around "how could you even recognize me? i went out looking like shit...didn't shave, didn't really do my hair, how the fuck would u know that was me?" i'm that good did you see me? doubtful...i saw 2 people i was attracted to...one being this asian kid dancing...and the other was the guy handing out beer with his shirt off you left right as i got there i passed right in front of you on my cellphone but i had my head down how would u know i was leaving? the guy with the orange shirt wasn't with me right when we were leaving left the dj on 12th anyway i stayed there for about 20 minutes he's not a dj...bartender oh the dj ha you mean where everyone was dancing? yup "why didn't you say ""hi""?" i like being sneaky ha...that's no fun it's lots of fun gathering intelligence i don't see how you could even come close to knowing who i was based on my pics greenish shirt "standing with a girl with long, dark hair" at least that's what i remember where were u standing? all my girls were getting hit on...it was so funny "then again, they are all very pretty" 2 of them were forced onto the dance area for a while me and julia grab on to each other and refused to dance b/c we weren't drunk i think that's what you were doing when i saw you i thought in this particular case the lesbians were much better dressed than the fags "which is out of the ordinary, or so says maria" i saw a couple girls that were smokin i almost always dance when i hear a dj i was so fucking beat that day too but it's fun to get more people going i wanted to dance...but i normally have to have a few drinks before i do where did you go afterwards home...to study stupid midterms i still have 1 more on Thurs in? accoutning accounting also bullshit i guess anything that arbitrary isn't very useful "it's like astrology, or number theory" i guess it's good to get a glance at the accounting world lol lets me know its not what i want to do "oddly enough, it's pretty much all i do when i'm involved in a business" i'm more into the start up of businesses...i'm extremely visual and creative...so i get wild ideas all the time my battery's almost dead catch you later "i do remember seeing you...you walked right in front of me heading towards the DJ booth...you were kinda tall, like 5'11""-6'00, on a phone, dark long hair, skinny...i remember seeing someone who looked like that."

"from our last conversation, i figure you're dating material" "um, that's a tough one.." you have a bf? no no no... what makes it tough? i never really date...i don't even know if i'm good at it or really how to do it... i haven't had a bf in years i haven't had a real boyfriend EVER! by choice? "um, no, not really..." have you been asked out before? yes. and you said no? no. how did it go? depends upon who it was with. but there have been times when you've enjoyed being out on a date i guess so. what would you do if i asked you out? i would accept graciously. do you like to dance? "i do, very much so." then you're a perfect date because that's what i do when i go out where do you go out? varies by weekend my roommates throw parties around town mixed crowd oh yeah? what kind of parties and where? "basically old heads, ex party kids, electronic music at decent bars and clubs - fluid, silk city, metro lounge, fiso, 5 spot, soma" that's the shit i love... i have such a blast at 'click' parties at fluid. you like fluid? yeah...i've had a good time the few times i've been there. oh i think you would like my friends very much then we're having a halloween party that you should come to at my house do you like breakbeats? yeah...some... both imri and al spin breakbeats when they're out also some house cool cool... and trance when no one is looking "i love dancing to old house, 80's cheese crap and electro." you would like mighty mike saga then and dave mass "i just went to the 'making time' party at transit on friday, music downstairs was fabulous but it was so fucking hot and so fucking crowded that i couldn't stay." ha i always sweat my balls off at transit it's gross in there. i bit a bit i like outdoor parties day parties never been... we just had one at a park up in north phil as a benefit for CHOP but i think they're pretty much over for the season CHOP? Children's Hospital oh..very cool. "yeah, you're definitely on my list" next time one comes around imri throws two monthlys "well, thanks." one at fluid called Funk Rock never heard..but sounds fun. "when i find out when it is, i'll let you know" i was a pure last night how was that? just all right "that's how that place always is, it's always just alright." "yeah, the music is pretty bad" i missed the entourage to metro lounge what time do you get off on the weekends? around 11:30 you work in new hope? yes. tough to make it out then definitely. "that's all changing after this weekend, starting a new job." now that's convenient for me hehe...yes it is. so so? at this point i'm trying to decide what to do with you you bear consideration what are you considering? short run vs. long term do you at all feel like driving to center city? yes and no...i've been contemplating it...it's the drive home that i'm fighting. and you have roommates...what are you going to do with them in the house? they are very much unconcerned i am so very entrigued and anticipating getting you naked... "yeah, i'd like to nibble on you for a bit" "i'm very put off though about roommates and family members though, especially since i don't know you...i would feel very 'trick'-like..." the offer stands for you to spend the night? thank you. i don't know if that mitigates the roommate factor "unfortunately, i have few other options" not really... i know that... it's just a bit bothersome i guess till i know you... so then let's go for the long term you'll have to come to one of our parties and maybe i'll get you face-to-face i'd have to know you before then... and we can laugh for a while when do you work? i'm on a flexible schedule for the time being like three days a week of my choosing ok. that's the kind of job i need. "it works, but there's something to be said for a routine" yeah...they suck. ha i was a graphic designer for a year the freedom was incredible i worked from home most often that would be cool. "it was during the summer, when i could move the office outside" that must've been so nice. here's a question for you... a little 'getting to know you' question. shoot what are you listening to right now??? ah ha ready for this? silence not often is it that way oh no...you should never have silence...that's bad for you...makes yr brain tell you crazy things... sometimes i need it "ugh..never, unless i'm reading can i be in silence, i'd go crazy." lately i've been listening to tears for fears aesop rock erlend oye new tears for fears? old oh okay. "'turn it on, turn it up, necisitto rock music, necisitto la la la'" i think i'm going to have to blow a load very very soon. aww i want to see it's yr fault. is it? i keep looking at yr pics. "and oh my god..i just realized yr not that much taller than me, that is fan-fuckin-tastic..." ha yeah i keep that in mind why's that? because it turns me on oh...awww... i have to get myself in shape again before you see me naked...i've been so damn lazy and now i'm just loose... loose? yeah...i have no tone at all...it's been so LONG since i've seen any kind of workout... "well, i'm in a lapse of exercise myself" "i lost weight and got flabby, hehe.." i just lost weight "i think i may go swimming tomorrow, that always gets me in shape quick.." brb k sorry bout that..had to pee than i was dancing with my dog... heh which dog is this kenny f. chompers sounds like quite the ball he's obnoxious... but i love him all the same.. i just looked at myself in the mirror when i went downstairs and was wondering how i got a scab on my bottom lip and forgot that he nailed me in the face with his head when i was playing with him earlier. what type of dog? chihuahua. heh a chihuahua gave you a scab? did he fall on your head? "he has a hard head, and he's ruthless..." he was shaking one of his toys a little to near my face and whacked me.. ahhhh my friend Seth has two the girl was a darling the boy not so much they're obnoxiously psychotic dogs and i should've listened to everyone's warning before i got him... "i shouldn't say that though, he is a super cool dog...he's very VERY friendly which i've known a lot of chihuahuas that aren't" most are very possesive and aggressive. my boy is just mildly retarded with a very bad case of ADD heh http://neocyde.net/vitals/grace.html that's grace awwww!!! i love her. who's holding her? me can i please have yr chest to take around with me everywhere...i'll keep it in my pocket and just rub it all the time... it puts the lotion in the basket yeah...i'll do something with yr basket too... are you on myspace? "oh my god. if you're going to talk that way, you better fucking come over" "i have an account, i think" "hehe..sorry, i'm teasing you now..." yup i am "i really shouldn't have said that to you, cuz now i'm all worked up again..." search for me on there and send me a friend request... my screenname is 'damaged goods' i got ten difference people when i searched for it? look for the picture with a girl holding a sign that says something about 'black guys with big cocks and hemmoroids'...that's me. of course hehe. "i found it, but it's giving me an ""unexpected error"" when i try to add you" those bastard whores. who are you on there? qubit "um, no yr not...hehe.." it said no matches. interesting http://profiles.myspace.com/users/1796837 no pictures? no profile? jeez...there's some issues you and i are going to have to get over... myspace isn't a regular stop for me it should be. http://neocyde.net is my site you should go to myspace before you go to manhunt... y? nah...actually i just started using myspace again.. i'm kidding. have you met people from myspace? nope...but i know a lot of the people in my friends group. have you met people on manhunt? a few any fun? most of the time cool. so it's very close to the time at which i fall aslweep "now see...i'd just be getting there about now if i left when you told me to, and yr falling asleep." really? how far is langhorne? about 25 minutes. oh no sir we've been at this for a bit longer than that "but you must understand, i worked 10 hours today running my ass off, i would've definitely had to clean up A LOT before i came to see you..." i like you better when you're dirty nah...this is way dirty. "i can be dirty, but not smelly." i fail to understand why people don't like their own scent scent is like 35% of attraction "i'm not a scent type person, i have to smell somewhat soap like or i'm not a happy camper, i'm very anal about cleanliness usually." put it this way i shower maybe two or three times a day if i can get away with it however i also will not wear deoderant if i can get away with it i always do... and i get teased constantly cuz of my teeth brushing habits. how long do you take to brush your teeth "not that i take long, it's that i'll do it a lot, like constantly at work..." i have a gum massager that's almost like masterbation ah ha ha ha. "the more you do it, the more it tingles" isn't that just like getting fucked? or is that cocaine? hmmm...that massager sounds very interesting. or is that getting fucked on cocaine? good point. it's got a nice head to it huh? the gum massager has a nice point on it "oh, i see..." do you have a mac or a pc? pc laptop. tell me something when you go to my site do the links work? "like, do they take you to the final pages?" "the artwork, etc?" what do you mean? the menu is in flash and when you click on the colored boxes they should take you to html pages they're not doing anything. i wonder why that is something to figure out ok "i'm really, really" going to bed wait..i just went through all the art links and owl and pele worked. ok so did maleficent. which ones don't? and why aren't there like a thousand naked picutres of you or the site? ha um all of them except the ones i told you. the only picture of me is the one with grace "and ""Head" final and head work. and oh my god..that's you in head? yes hehe..yr scary. yeah i was a crackhead oh my god..i just clicked it and got you with no hair... bonus feature look at the retinas what the hell were you on? no idea and yr god damned sweaty. from a party hehe. it's silly. a bit how long ago was that? three years? i really like what i was able to turn it into i don't like that pic of me at all it's freaky either way... but i'll still say that you are super handsome even in the crackhead stylee... thanks now go to bed and stop bothering me. i think all the ones with photos work that way ok sleep well you too...hopefully i'll catch up with you tomorrow or soon. it would be my pleasure "aw, thank you...mine too." ok lateres hello handsome. howdy howzit? it's a-ok....how you is? i be fine what's up 2night?

"it's not out yet, but yes and the first single was just released." neat her i like she's one of the most amazing creatures ever to walk this planet...i don't think i've ever met anyone that hates her. oh i have. one of the girls in my dorm freshman year used to watch them in LA like 10 years ago and she hates her? she was hating the fact that they became famous can i have that girls name and address so i can beat her ass... caroline.kriz@gucci.com i think hehe..i was kidding. i wouldn't mind at all if you beat her ass "well, if you really want me to, i will." as long as there's footage "hehe, you can watch.." i'm a huge fan of watching i'm a huge fan of group participation. as long as there's a tripod somebody's got to hold the camera actually.. i was in a foursome a few weeks ago with a GRRL fucking odd i must say really? really really that's hot i thought so when's the last time you played with a group? three weeks ago... Heh that made me smile it was the first time...it was so hot.. oh yeah? yeah yeah. how many ppl? me and two a couple? yeah how did you meet them? been friends for years... oo! "i used to find couples a lot years ago, but haven't been doing it so much lately.. what did you like about it most?" two people paying attention to me... heh i can see that it was fun fun fun... do you think you'll do it again? "they want me to...and they told me they have a sling to play with, so yeah, i want to.." ha a sling SOOO much fun never played with one.. are you more of a bttm or top? and i sooooo want to bad... "either or, i love them both..." "but usually if i get fucked, i'm fucking you right back." ha getting fucked in a sling is singular i would love it... i'm sure you will was it a party or did you just go over to hang out? i'm sorry...i ran to take a shower and forgot to tell you... ha np "i was high, and was talking to one of the guys from the couple, he told me they always had a thing for me, i giggled and said i'm coming home with you guys, he giggled and didn't believe me, i said i'm serious, i'm going home with you guys, let's leave now. he told his boyfriend, we walked out the door, i followed the one home, jerking the other one off while i was driving, went to their house and had my clothes off for about 30 hours or so..." "sorry, way to much info.." 30 hours. i've been salivating for a weekend like that for a while i've never had a weekend like that... "i was so out of it when i left, but it fulfilled a lot of sexual tension that was building up." "so, i was good for a while." did you party while you were there? yep. "i was before i went there, that's how i got the balls up to go there." <sigh> so much fun yeah..very much so. i was a pretty involved crackhead for a minute i have been on and off for about 8 years now... "i'm starting to get on the off for a bit now, but that could always change." we never really quit we just get picky or bored for the time being. or broke. heh brb my battery is going to die "i'm gonna get going now anyway, my friend shawn is here (i think), we're gonna run to the mall and then find something to do...i'll find you later sexy man..." laters adios hotsy.. :) hi mister super hottie.. hi hello how art thou we's be dandy...how you is? i be fine how was yr weekend? how is yr penis? busy did you go to outfest? i did.. and i actually enjoyed myself emmencely. i did too where were you at? had no idea it was going on until i took a walk through the neighborhood i walked around the blocks for a bit and then ended up by the dj on 12 and spruce i didn't know about till like 2 in the morning on saturday night... i never even made over there.. i didn't get to the city until around 5:30 - 6 spent the majority of the night at woodys. i danced more last night then i think i have in the past year.. i did not want to leave the dancefloor. im sorry i missed that woodys was crowded? "yeah...was really really crowded when i first got there, then slowed down a little bit around 9" i left the city about the time you got there missed the crowds figures. "the music coming out of Pure was better than the other stages, but i couldn't tell if anyone was there or not" "that's why we went to woody's so early...the streets were so mobbed, it was annoying walking around." ha "we didn't end up at pure till about 12:30...it wasn't packed, but it got a little busier around 2" and then i left. with anyone? huh? did you pick up anyone at the club? "i sucked a few dicks, but nothing memorable." fun fun i'm totally kidding.. "actually, i was missing the random cockshots. the folsom street fair has one on philly" "i stuck to my friend eric's side all night and the two of danced like fools till we couldn't move anymore, then we both went home alone in our own seperate cars." dancing until i drop used to be a career for me i just worked up a small sweat yesterday "me too...when i was 17 to 22...i was dancing last night like i was a kid..i felt so old when i left...my back was killing me, my knees were throbing.." "hehe, i think that's the first time i ever felt my age, or any age at all.." i know what you mean 25 kind of sneaks up on you "i never cared about birthdays...18 was blah, 21 was stupid, i thought 25 was going to be great and i would make a big change and 26 i found drugs again, so i'm on a roll with maybe not even making it to 30, hehe." i never thought i would see 24 now i'm hoping i have a mortgage and a kid by the time i'm 30 ok "oh, ew." not really thank god you took that back..hehe. it has crossed my mind though and when it did i was like wtf "when it did, you took another pill?" ha if only they were around i party maybe 3 or 4 times a year now all my connections scattered to the four corners halloween will likely be one of them tho are you coming to our party? "um, i don't know...we never really got into it that much." into what? "into the specifics of the party, the specifics of us hanging out, blah blah blah." ahhh "well, come then" heh it's friday at our house this friday? filled with what is very likely going to be a lot of intense people the 29th bring friends ugh...the 29th i'm going to see le tigre. but let me know how many le tigre? girl punk electro band.. please tell me you've heard of le tigre.. maybe in some past conversation with Mark maybe from you? well what you need to do now is start downloading everything you can find by them cuz they're fucking wonderful. do you remember bikini kill? ha what? "no recollection, senator" okay..nevermind then. i'll educate you on the two bands one day when we're driving around in my car with the iPod. hot "well, where is the concert and how late does it go?" "it's at the TLA, i believe it starts at 8 with 2 opening bands." come afterwards. the party will def be all night "i'll see if i can get the peeps to come with me...they might...i know allison will, she's the friendliest girl in the world and loves meeting new people." neat will be several djs lots of party favors very cool. invite only so you're invited can i get on the guest list w/ comps? "um.,,, SURE" ha hehe..don't you know who i am... you know the dj? NO? well either does anybody else... which one? i keed nope. ha don't think so.. <i kid "oh, duh...i thought 'i keed' was some bad name that came about of one to many nights of no sleep." nah prolly imri and kil0byte and who knows who else basically whoever jumps behind the decks "aw, bikini kill just came on AOL radio, woohoo." okay..well don't tell allison 'whoever jumps behind the decks' cuz she just bought turntables and wants to be 'miss dj supreme' lots of the kids who are coming are djs like more than 20 probably imri has huge bookcase full of records on the third floor and three out of the four bedrooms have decks i'll probably know someone or peeps will look familiar.. you probably will! i never really got in with the dj's ever. i didn't either. these kids just show up at mah house i know how that is.. that's my old apartment was in the city. when did you move out? i lived in the city when i was 18 that must have been fun "nah...i really didn't like it much...and it was very short lived in a dump apartment with horrible people in and out all hours of the night, i never got comfortable there." "that's why i cancelled the lease one day, took all my stuff and moved it and took all 50 other peoples things that lived there and put it all on the fire escape, the dumpster and all their clothes were donated to the lovely bums of philadelphia." damn i had to get my pay backs some how. who was it that was taking advantage? my roommate and her thirty friends that she moved in and out every other day...and that fat bitch wasn't even paying rent... i was selling everything i owned and cashing in savings bonds and borrowing money to keep us living there. ouch she was your friend beforehand? yeah...it wasn't the best situation. she was my high school best friend. damn that's a tough ending "that was the end...hehe, that was chapter one." "that's why i eventually moved in with my grandmom and decided i will never move out of my house again, i am staying here the rest of my life, haha." wow i know the feeling Maria had to drag me out of my g-mom's house and i'm still here 4 days a week are you at granny's now? yup where's that at? Woodbury NJ okay. my gran and i are best friends. she's the coolest bitch ever. ha she's sparky? fuck yeah. like how "she's got her shit together, she's always on the go, and she's just wonderful." good deal i just offered to buy my g-mom's house over the eweekend so she could stay here by making it senior-friendly "now see, and yr grandmom is yr best friend." pretty much. she's the only person i'm completely dorky around and she tells me things she won't tell anyone else "hehe..well i'm dorky around just about everyone, it's no holds barred with me, but my gran sees me at my worst." yeah. something about living here on and off for three years plus she's seen me go through a LOT of shit i've been here for over six. and you're staying for good? "no no..i was kidding about that...i was supposed to move around july-ish, post poned that for a while, then it changed to september, made a change to october but with leaving my job and starting a new one and all this other crap we're just gonna wing it now, and i'll move in whenever, i'm in no hurry at all." where are you moving to? "about a mile from where i live now, hehe.. my best friend owns a large house that she is now in by herself so the dog and i are gonna be her roommates." cool. the one thing about moving out was that i started getting laid often again. hehe...yr so lucky... just appreciative a little jealousy. who's jealous? "i'm jealous that you get to be slutty whenever you want, and i don't." see? something about moving out i had ppl over while i was here but not often i'm telling yr grandmom. she would be suprised not "my grandmom always asks me why when the guys sleep over, they always sleep in my room with me. but the girls feel it necessary to sleep on the floor or downstairs on the couch. she always yells at me and says she knows i'm being mean and not letting girls in my bed." hahahahahahahaaaa does she know you're gay? yeppers. what are you going to be for halloween? i haven't thought about that. is yr party a costume mandatory party? nah but most ppl will have them i highly doubt i will coming straight from the show. ok what are you going to be? i'm still considering it what are yr options? Atreiu from the Neverending Story maybe but Maria doesn't think anyone will get it i think i lost my connection for a second. did you send me something? "SOMEotherBOY: get one of the dolls or something to carry around with you, i forget the girls name, but get a doll of her to pal around with you." did you get that? nope thanks i don't think she had a name until the end of the first movie and then who knows what the fuck that kid said call her bob. hs hahaha yer funny no one will question you cuz who actually knows her name. call her princess pussy lips. i am chewing my bottom lip off. whyfor? from being so high yesterday...the nerves are all crazy so i'm grinding my lip over my teeth. ah yes you know the feeling so well? hehe. did you sleep? i used to grind the fuck out my teeth like scary bad not since saturday afternoon. "i never did the teeth grinding that much, i've actually never did anything with my mouth until recently, mine was always with my hands." hands? "they were always into something, rubbing and pulling my knuckles and touching stuff." heh fresh holy shit! did you know that Jonathan Brandis DIED? i don't know who that is..but i heard superman is dead to and rodney dangerfield. http://www.jonathanbrandis.org/ i used to this he was SO HOT oh shit suicide! who is he? he was the kid on Seaquest okay. ha "hehe...the monkees 'daydream believer' just came on AOL radio, but shonen knife is doing it...hehe..so cute." what is this AOL radio you speak of? are you on aol or just aim? AIM then you can't get it... D'oh "if you have aol, there's hundreds of different stations you can pick from and they just stream thousands and thousands of songs 24 hours a day." right now i'm listening to the 'indie rock girl' station. i have to stick with public radio eh. it's not that bad princeton has a good station and so does drexel i don't get it around here usually. and drexel's doesn't come in anywhere around here. no shit? yep.

I couldnt believe it whoa the girl is a miracle worker so then we are all high and get into a converesation about going to the show and running into Maria which i didnt think would be too weird but when your stoned everything is more hardcore TRUE so that made me start to feel a bit weird and all ok.. then we go to the show and the fucking bartender ripped jess off for 5 bucks ew so she asks to see a manager ha and still high as chong and the manager sees us and gives up 2 free drink passes seriously? seriously hold on one sec k anyway we got 2 free drinks and like good tanqueray and rum and then we run into this guy that jess is friends with who i was annoyed by the last time we saw him because i thought he was a bit too friendly but turns out he and i really get along for the night cool yeah so THAT was unexpected ha and than grandmaster flash came out opened with In the Air Tonight by Phil fucking Collins!

I was hanging out with this girl I met on myspace... she uber hot and fun to dance with... I've decided to collect hot friends as to beautiful the scenery ha haha yeah but no... I was drunk all my friends are beautiful! i only associate with hot kids yeah me too... but i want more damn it... it's like pringles... you just can 't have one heh Wes silly did you go to Lisa's? nope... I wasn't in the mood for a drugged out morning.. I slept till 1 good idea now i'm relaxing yeah... I need to clear my head not confuse it i haven't even smoked pot for 2 weeks whoa! weston that's a great suprise how do you feel? bored haha but good i've been working 12 hours days for the last week... so there's no time for partying. I work then I sleep. somewhere in between... I talk to misa and fall a little deeper. is she one of the reasons you quit? hell NO!! she's a pot head time infinity oh yeah? I'm trying to get my head together it's good to take a break once and a while esp. before a big life change you mean her moving here? yeah... that's pretty big.... wouldn't you say? I also want to get this Live PA off the ground... that's why last night was my last DJ set for a while i just need to focus i feel that i never wanted to be a DJ... from minute one i wanted a Live PA... so I need to make that happen... before it's too late heh well make it happen but as long as you want it that's my plan it's not too late exactly.... i just don't want to lose the passion for it... can't do both... i find it hard to believe that you would must focus on one i never want to see it... even if it's not possible... don't risk it just because you don't believe it will not happen anything's possible... ha yes very ok brb... food time... ok i'll catch up with you laters i'll be back later :D :) thanks for coming out no problem dude i was glad you were there thank you for putting it together :) :D "weston, how are you my love?" good good busy will we see you tonight at dbotz? "working on misa's move, writing a new song, working, and today I get a new kitty" yes OH YAY wow! we're (me & ian) are going to Andrew engagement party first then we'll be back up and probably tanked send him my love i will :) i'll have a surprise for you when you get there REALLY! really really YAY! :D :) ok enjoy your day you too!! :) UGH! "congrats, bro!" oh hey thanks what's up? nothing... misa makes my head hurt sometimes... now she's not coming until god only knows like she's sooo unsure of things and it sucks because on the other side of that sometimes she is sure *bangs head against desk* women... *shakes head* deep breath like she wants to move here with me but she doesn't want to move here for me... and I'm cool with that... but she doesn't think I understand and she freaks when I tell her I do i know she's at a scary time but tht doesn't mean she has to do it alone... but I can't convince her of that it's kind of frustratiing.. i just want her here already... i'm thinking maybe it would be better if she did it on her own me too... sort of.. now... im just worries that she'll never get here... and i'll be left... right where I was before... alone... and very confused. boohiss heh i need a drink check it out the only way it's going to work is if you can be ok if it doesn't i know otherwise you're co-dependent but sometimes I think its going to work... then... it does' t like right now I could be hanging out with maria... but Im not because I might have this life coming up with misa so it's like im on hold for something that might not even happen for once in my life im getting attention... I don't know who's to accept being a monk fucking sucks! lol yup maria's nice and being friends with her will be cool... but she reminds me of misa it sucks why can't i just be a bastard like every other guy on the planet... being wholesome sucks! i could just spit *kicks dirt* Weston it's a point of view you can be wholesome and enjoy it or you can be dirty and not care but doesn't have to use two good things to make bad im confused just enjoy yourself right now and don't worry about what might be but what if it bites me in the ass "im scared, mike.. scared of ruining something I don't even know I have..." but at the same time... much easier to say that you made the decisions knowing you were happy i'm lonely.. "and really, you can keep making decisions that way" they work themselves out at least in my experience so far i guess I just don't want anyone to get hurt but I... maybe I can't prevnt that for the rest of my life... you absolutely should not fall before your fear if you're afraid of something you go out and do it BECAUSE you are afraid and by doing it you rid yourself of the fear and see what happens? and the lesson :( poop LOL i guess your right... life happens one way or the other today could end up interesting... then im going to hang out with maria... 've been putting it off becasue of fear don't be afraid of her maybe it's better this way.. its not her it the situation "we are ""playful"" people..." things that could happen.. is what I've feared. that's why i've been a monk.. because of fear don't be afraid go with it? it will work out hmmm... ok *hug* wish me luck luck "have a bitchin night, kitten!" you as well i'll tell her you said hello :) spanks :D "congrats agian, brain-e-ack!" :D thanks dude i appreciate it now go back to planning your world domination :D heh laters p's oooo... you're a little plotter... ;) buahahahaha she's really awesome thou i know this we had a great time hanging out i'm pleased but not by my design with yourself? was your own doing :p riiiiiiiiiiight seriously You put things into motion thou i'd rather just watch it happen lil plotter LOL stop not me i'm innocent denile is just a river in Jersey right behind me house Maria enjoyed herself as well im wanna go swimming no SHIT :D my pool has to cure for another week bofore it opens damn i like night swimming with no clothes *giggle* lil plotter :p HEH things just happen yep im just going to see what happens GOOD we talked about it for a long time that's what's best it was an incredibly honest conversation which is great and rare that's why i think you two should talk and by the by you found her all by yourself remember? i found you too at Fluid talking to each other sans introduction you introduced us at Transit.. i remember you doing that she was at transit ? LOL oh wes mmhm oh.... really *scratchs head* I thought I met her at fluid for the first time nope for future reference i was sober at transit i know i didn't meet her there because I was spinning and pissed of f breif we were dancing together i think i didn't get the introduction then Ian didn't you did adam and ian did i'm pretty sure about that wait maybe you're right was it the other way around? ian siad you were this a hot chick i never saw her OK well there you go you're still a lil plotter my surprise LOL i wanna swim so hot in sweaty here we used to crash the pool on top of the Sheraton im damn near naked right now so hot in here go outside! get hosed off maria's got a hose you should show up to her house with a kiddie pool LOL and go snorkeling i would too i know this oh i wanna go snorkling ;) haha bad kitty nooooo me?

I think they could be friends. they are hella similar i think that would be an easy thing yeah so good to hear al's dragging his new toy all over the place haha he's deep into his koolaid yep! :) its like christmas... only I didn't get shit! coal you get i got a 40 and a buritto now all we need is a pool and some pussy lol yeah... cats are cool ;) esp when you stroke them im sure you're good at that :p "the best, or haven't you heard" i didn't get that memo ;) oh then you have more stories to hear LOL im sure you have skill *giggle* it's like watching lesbian porn in order to learn how to eat pussy properly... :P "heh, practice makes perfect" nobody knows how to handle the stick like someone with the stick.

LOVED dude i'm being attacked by june bugs they just want kisses *flush* no kisses for them i had an interesting day. it sucked... had to do everything I didn't want to do and now you don't have to do anything you don't want to do? but it turned out to be heaven. yeah The truth set me free. and the response to that truth gave me more hope than I could hold hope is like jello... you can't have too much. i like to take baths in it sounds like heavy stuff? I love maria. Maria loves me. Misa knows. Everyone's still happy. And everything is going to be ok. when does misa get here? don't know that for her to decide... the pressure is off. Now she can be free to do what she wants for herself. better I told her the truth and we talked for a while... it was good at least you know she's been a real friend this whole time yES! she said the only thing she asks is that I've never walk away. "And I told her we are ""friends for life""." just like I am with all of you. :) what a relief for you both thanks! :) "np chief, i'm glad you're enjoying your perspective a little mettter" betta oh... what are telling her? tisk tisk what did i say never mind.. she's confused that's nothing new LOL im confused like that too. she wants a mint julip just so you know sorry you lost your job... :( *hug* "eh, it's a pretty good thing in fact" it was bound to happen i know that feeling well i'm glad i found out when i did yeah... now you are free to move on to bigger and better things :) ha in the long run definitely i'm disappointed about not moving but it gives me the opportunity to take care of my Penn bill my dad wants me to start working with him in Jersey how well would that work...? probably stressful do you get along with him ha sometimes not going to be easy work but it's worthwhile well that's something wouldn't have happened this way if it wasn't the right thing to do yeah good outlook in the face of unfortunate events right just a change really that's cool. :) how's the house hunt going for you? horribly. oh man i'm now getting worried. it's sooooo hard finding a half way decent place for cheap in this city... not impossible... but very hard very true are you just looking in CC? yeah... and in the close surroundings i like being able to walk places without 30 minutes going by haa it makes the search harder im going to look at a place on Friday at 22 & spruce. that's a great neighborhood it's a basement apartment with a patio so I don't know but it's cheap and the area IS great definitely when i was looking for a single that's the area i thought would work out best i hope it does i'm getting frustrated but I have karma on my side... at least I hope I do. i usually do i'm sure it will work out you have options at least some but few it'll work out it has to I have to get out of here. before I knock Imri out ha i didn't get a response from him but so he knows... I was going to ask... but I decided I didn't want to hear him bitch i'm not worried about it really oh yeah don't be i called and left a message and also sent a message they have a month to find someone he'll just have to deal which with what they have should be easy it will be "i regret that it didn't work out way ahead of time for them, but i'm also not sure i was set up with the best situation if i did more in" move in he didn't believe I was moving for the first 6 times I told him was ha well i'm only telling him once good Maria's going to kill him... or whip him to shape... "yeah, and that's before she's even moved in" whatever happens first that's what he needs. but if he hits on her again... I'm going to hit him... hard. ha i wonder if he's ever been socked probably probably. he & I barely speak these days... when we do it's civil... but that's all me... i'm holding back until I move. i wanna slip out quietly. i can dig that myself has been piped up pretty often lately probably to my own detriment but for some reason i don't feel like putting up with bullshit yeah i know the feeling im sure you had things youi wanted to say to me. ha not really not nearly as many as maria wanted me to say but i've removed myself from the issue entirely really? it's probably safer that way LOL truer words have never been spoken trying to explain or question my mental issues is hard. Maria handles it well... but it's best to leave it up to her. She's keeping my interest just fine. um Wes And she controls my issues like no other my advice to you is to control your own issues oh I do. but she is the motivation... the looking glass. I see who I could be in her eyes... who I am :) who I forgot I was "yeah, she has a skill for elevation" but she's also human i know... that's why it's the buddy system... I try to give back what she gives to me. it good policy just as long as you give it back on both ends don't be her bitch it's unbecoming :p she's a tough cookie... you know... but oh so sweet. and tasty. ha "she's acts tough, that's for sure" HA i'm seeing that now... she's a soft cookie... like myself. ;) in some ways she is very vulnerable like everyone else i know as am I she fights back though we should start a club if you press her buttons it's borderline irrational boy do I knoww that but i totally understand how that happens we take turns being irrational and I also know when to step back and let her get it all out before I speak it's about... patience. im learning that again "yeah, i'm glad you two worked out your differences" i'm probably going to bow out of the scene for a while she'll need someone you can bow out of the scene (god knows I have) but don't you dare bow out from us. i'm just getting to know you...with her. "nah, i think it's going to be all inclusive. you and she will have your space, i'll be around but it's time to let that rest for a while" boohiss :( ha it's an unavoidable cycle that i go through ok i'm going for food i'll catch up with you later enjoy your night I can only say this one thing before I leave from work... thank you for bringing Kim to your party. :) she came on her own but no problem I had fun thanks!!!! yw have a great night!!! you too Kim's coming tonight to go dancing. You wanna join us? Also... she said to check your email. hey hi "what's ""spider"" solitaire?" "thanks, this is much easier than trying to talk through mancunt" ha TRUE "it's like solitaire, obviously, but with more cards, and more rules." double deck? yes do you play with a real deck or on the computer? PC do you play anything else? i used to play reversi a lot hmmm you got me again also called othello ah better cards are one of my secret loves but not many people i know play oh yeah? def spades hearts bridge ueker euker "i don't play much... just spider solitaire, when i'm bored" slow day then?

"there's no real plan. i started doing menial tasks, and when my boss had time to train me on something new, he did. he goes at his own pace, so i have no idea really." how did you meet him?
